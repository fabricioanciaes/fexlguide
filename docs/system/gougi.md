title: Gougi
summary: Brief overview of how Gougis works
---
### What Are Gougi?

Gougi is the most recognizable unique mechanic for Fighting Ex Layer. When you pick your character, you also choose a deck of Gougi. Gougi is a set of 5 powerups that activate when certain conditions are met and give passive or active effects for the rest of the match (not just the round, the whole match!)

### How does Gougi work?

For the sake of example, let's take a look at Aggro:

***BIG OLD AGGRO DECK IMAGE HERE***

The Trigger is the condition you need to fill for the Gougi's Effect to activate. So, with Grab Up, once you land 2 non-command throws, you get a nice 20% increase to your grab range for the rest of the match. Erase Blow also has a simple Trigger with a simple but useful effect. 

You'll notice these less impactful Gougi are in blue, blue signifying that they are easy to get but not massively powerful.

Yellow Gougi on the other hand are much more difficult to Trigger, often requiring more than one round to Trigger. They make up for this with extremely powerful effects that are often the centerpiece of the deck. Illusion requires taking 300 damage (For reference, characters have 200 health, meaning this will always take at least one round to Trigger.) but give you an automatic free escape from 1 highly damaging combo per round. 

Rampage is what makes Aggro the Aggro deck as its Effect increases your damage as you hit the opponent up to a max of 30 stacks (1% damage increase per stack???) while having a fairly reasonable Trigger to activate early in the match.

Essentially, Blue Gougi are nice bonuses while Yellow Gougi are the powerful effects that you build up to in a match. These will also affect your character's playstyle, allowing them to play up their strengths or cover their weaknesses. Allen Snider loves Infinity as he wants meter, is good at building it up and constantly being topped up with the Rage Effect allows him to consistently do full Triple Break Loops to finish off matches. A Darun Mister on the other hand can take Thunderbolt, allowing him to use the Teleport Gougi to warp on top of the opponent, negating his poor mobility.

### What should I base my Gougi Deck choices on?

While there will be "best" Decks for characters, if you want to mess around with the Decks, first consider what the character wants to do. Grab Master probably won't get much mileage on Kairi and his lack of command grabs for example. Doctrine Dark has excellent mixup but not an amazing approach so Shinobi with its Ghost Gougi covers his weakness and allows his strength to excel.

Also, do you want to enjoy the effects of your Gougi as soon as possible or are you okay being relatively weaker than your opponent for the beginning of the match? Some Decks require completely changing the way you play to Trigger the Gougi such as Miracle or Super Nova. Shinobi has very good effects especially considering how easy the Triggers are, but compared to a fully activated Juggernaut is arguably less powerful.

Most characters thankfully have more than one optimal deck in any case, so you'll still be able to mess around and not hamper yourself. See the character pages for recommendations.

      Super Armour means that your character doesn't recoil from most hits. You
      will still take damage, but you will be able to fully act. This means your
      character can get full punishes on BEING hit by an opponent, walk through
      projectiles and consistently win trades. However, being knocked down,
      juggled or launched will still work as normal against Super Armour. Damage
      that is Super Armour'd through will be unscaled, so notably multihit moves
      and supers will actually do more damage than normal (For example, Allen
      Snider's Fire Force.)

    <td>
      Harkening back to Guard Breaks from Street Fighter EX2, your Hard Attacks
      will become Guard Breaks for 1 bar of meter. Guard Breaks are flashy
      unblockable attacks that if they land will cause the opponent to reel for
      a very long time. You should be able to get full punishes each time with
      this, and some characters have extremely good setups to make sure the
      Guard Break lands such as Doctrine Dark. They're also just useful as a
      mixup tool regardless. If you don't have a bar of meter, a normal Hard
      Attack comes out instead.

      A fantastic Yellow Gougi that makes any character's approach incredibly

      gougi (If you're managing to stay alive long enough that you can get the
      25 Special Attacks off and have no Gougi to use until then, you would

      chain, not a link) before going to the higher Strength. This lets you do
      something like <code>LP > LK > MP > MK > HP > HK</code>. Allows you to pull off some

      Similar to Energy Drain except this works just by staying close to the
      opponent. This means this is active while standing next to them, even on
      block, and also in any combos that keep you close enough. Many Supers will
      also keep you close enough to have it active, and throws are especially
      good for getting the full use of Soul Drain. The health loss can never
      kill but will leave the opponent at 1 Health. A very difficult Gougi to

      for special moves with a reasonable Trigger to pull off. However, it
      suffers from a really major downside in that all stacks are lost if the
      move is blocked or whiffed, making it actually a fairly underwhelming
      Gougi overall. Is still good for characters that can hit-confirm into
      specials and don't need to throw them out constantly .

      reversals going to 15.) A decent reward but given that reversals are
      pretty dangerous if blocked most of the time, this makes this Gougi not
      very useful and worthless if you're not getting knocked down.

      reversal effect is dangerous and not applicable if you're not getting
      knocked down.

      This Gougi is often outright bad. It offers roughly a 33% damage increase
      on the super at the expense of your entire meter and will provide less of
      a damage boost the less meter you have. For example, D.Dark's
      EX-Prominence goes from a base 34 to 51 with 3 bars which is pretty
      pathetic. Spending the same amount of meter to do Dark Shackle > Dark
      Knife > Dark Shackle does 49 damage and that's with a very poor Super
      sequence. Any supers that relaunch naturally become much worse as they can
      no longer loop. If your character can only have 1 super in a combo it may
      be slightly better, It's usually always better to do 3 separate supers in
      3 combos or strings than do slightly more damage in one.

      A surprisingly effective Gougi. Using Allen as an example, his Soul Force
      deals 2 chip damage, so Chip Up adds 50% damage. Fire Force deals 1 chip
      damage 5 times, meaning that Chip Up adds 100% damage. Basically, the more
      hits something has, the more effective Chip Up becomes making it superb on
      characters with many-hit blockstrings that use specials or supers (For
      example, Shadowgeist.).

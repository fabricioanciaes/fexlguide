## Move Analysis

### Notation

This guide uses Numpad notation. That means that directions correspond to the numbers on your keyboard numpad (ie. 6 is right, 4 is left, 8 s up, 2 is down). 5 means no direction held. For example, the classic Hadoken quartercircle motion would look like 236, the classic Tatsumaki/Hurricane Kick motion is 214 and the classic Shoryuken motion is 623.

For special moves, the first input is the classic input, the second is the progressive input.

Cancel means you can do something else as soon as your first move hits IE. `2MK` on hit can go straight into a special move if you input the special move as `2MK` would hit. Special Cancel means you can cancel into Special Moves and Super Cancel means you can cancel into Super Moves.

Link means you have to let the move finish first before you can do another move.

Lows are moves that have to be blocked crouching. Most crouching kicks hit low.

Mids are moves that can blocked either crouching or standing. Almost all standing moves, special moves, supers and crouching punches hit mid.

Highs/overheads are moves that must be blocked standing. Most jumping attacks and all Hard Attacks (`MP + MK`) hit high/overhead.

Startup means how long it takes for the move to actually hit.

S.blo stands for standing block. In this case, it shows the difference in time between you recovering from your attack and the opponent recovering from blocking your attack. If it's 0, you both recover and can act at the same time. If it's -1 or lower, the opponent recovers faster and can act before you. If it's 1 or higher, you recover faster and can act before the opponent.

C.blo is similar but when the opponent crouch blocks instead.

## Gameplan
### Neutral

What are the character's pokes?

Do they have a fireball game? Do their specials have application in the neutral? (IE. Allen's fireball game, D.Dark's EXplosives and Dark Wire)

How do they antiair?

How is their mobility? Are they fast? Is their jump arc notable?

### Offense
### Mix-Ups

High-low mixups? Do they focus more on frame traps or tickthrows? Any left-right mix up? Do they have a solid throw game? Do any gougis they take give them mix up options?

### Set-Ups

!!! quote "Some move that knocks down into another move"
    Is this a chip setup? Is it for oki/vortex?

### Frame-Traps

!!! quote "Any Delayed Chain"
    As there is always a big window for you to chain one move to a higher strength, essentially any button can become a frame trap by simply delaying the next button just enough to allow a gap for an opponent to press a button that'll then get hit by your delayed button before their move can start up.
    
    The easiest way of practicing this by setting the training dummy to "After First Hit" and Guard All (Standing) or Guard All (Crouching), and setting either `5LP` or `2LP` in a slot for "Recording Settings (After Guard).
    
    The dummy will try to jab their way out of any gaps and if you've delayed correctly, you'll hit the dummy out of the startup of their jab. `2MP` or `2MK` are great normals to try and frame trap from.

!!! quote "Some normal > Other normal or special"
    Specific examples.



### Defense
Does your character have anything interesting outside of the normal defensive routes (it's good to note normal defense regardless). Do they just have to hold pressure or can they worm their way out? Do they take any decks that help them with defense (Guard cancel etc.)

### Reversals

Do they have wising dwagon (also all supers have invuln as well I guess)

### Escapes

Is your character particularly good for getting out? Teleports for example? Any Gougi that helps?

## Character Specific Techniques
## Combos

All characters can chain from a normal to a higher strength normal, either punch or kick. Chains work off cancels, meaning that the button doesn't have to finish its animation and can go immediately to the next normal. When links are mentioned, that means the normal HAS to finish and then you can get the next normal to come out. These tend to be harder. Unique/command normals chain from any normal.

### Bread And Butter Combos

(Note: Almost all of these strings will work from jump in starters.)

#### Universal Strings

!!! quote "2/5LK > 2/5MK > 2HK"
    A nice, safe(?) and fairly rewarding chain as it scores you a knockdown and works off your standing or crouching kicks.

!!! quote "2/5LK > 2/5MK > Command Normal > (Special/Super)"
    A slightly more risky string as Command Normal is poor on block.

!!! quote "2/5LK > 2/5MK > Special > Super"
    A nice and beginner friendly combo. Drop the combo at the special.    

#### Dash-In combos

!!! quote "2MP > 2MP > 2MK > Special/Command Normal > ([Example Super Loop](#examplesuperloops)/ Other Super)"
    The momentum from your dash allows you to link (Not chain, so timing is a lot more strict) a second `2MP` which can then link into `2MK`.
    
    This is definitely more difficular than your chains and on blocks there's fairly noticeable gaps that the opponent can jab through. Mix it up with cancelling your `2MP`s into `Something`.
    
    A very respectable punish combo against very unsafe moves like Rising Dragons or many blocked supers.

### Hit-Confirms

!!! quote "2LK> 2MK > Command normal > Whatever"
    If `command normal` will be blocked, it's better to go into `X` or `Y` instead.

!!! quote "Whatever > Special"
    Special is safe on block or chips or whatever.

### Anti-Air Conversions

!!! quote "AntiAir Normal > Super / Special"
    Does Range matter? Is it an immediate cancel?

### Air to Air Conversions

!!! quote "j.MK/HK > Special / Super"
    Is this Height dependent? Do you need to land?


### Example Super Loop

!!! quote "Whatever > Super > Combo Filler > Super > Combo Filler > Super > Combo Ender"
    Any particular input tricks? How does hitstun decay affect the later part of the combos?

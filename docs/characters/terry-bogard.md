## Brief Overview

### Type of Character

Terry Bogard, a guest character originally from the Fatal Fury games and a mainstay of King Of Fighters is a shoto on steroids. His high damage and complete kit  [[summary of his playstyle, moves and so on]]

!!! success "Strengths"
    - Solid fireball game with a good selection of antiairs
    - Easily converts meter to damage with [Power Geyser Loops](#power-geyser-loops) from both grounded strings and anti-airs
    - Has an extremely well-rounded kit with a great fireball, 2 special anti-airs in Rising Tackle and Crack Shoot, a strong special linker with Burn Knuckle and a command grab (for reasons unknown to man)
    - Very solid selection of normals with a sweep that's both safe on block and special cancellable.

!!! failure "Weaknesses"
    - Has a fairly poor kara-cancel from his sweep which keeps his potential command grab game in check
    - Somewhat stubby normals combined with a somewhat slow run speed makes his approach mediocre compared to many other characters in the cast.
    - Has no safe supers to cancel into and unsafe specials (with the exception of a spaced Power Wave) forcing Terry to hitconfirm correctly or otherwise end in unrewarding strings to stay safe when pressuring.
    - His fireball game is not as strong as other characters and will often lose the fireball war.
 

### 5 Minute Guide

(if you don't know what the abbreviations mean, check the [notation](#notation) guide below.)

Take Infinity as your deck, lets you gain 130% meter almost immediately, after doing 10 supers you get a rapidly regenerating super bar. Other decks you could use is Aggro as a general beginner friendly deck, or Stealth Raptor if you want to have Terry bring his shorthops along from KOF.

`2LK`, `2MK`, `2MP`, and `5MK` are solid pokes with `2HK` being a slower but longer range option to catch out enemy pokes and dash ins.

Many of your special moves do move you forward but are unsafe on block. Stick to `236LP/6LP` and general movement to approach safely.

`2HP` is your go-to antiair. Unlike many heavy attacks, it is special cancellable, letting you easily combo into a `214LP/4LP` which can then go into a [Power Geyser Loop](#power-geyser-loops) or `236236K/46K`. Otherwise you have [2]8K and 214K/4K

For combos, start off with light kicks or punches, move up to medium kicks or punches and then either to heavy kicks or punches or special moves. Dashing in will make your combos far more consistent. `2LK` > `2MK` > `2HK` > (`236P/6P` on block) is a solid and safe string that will knock down on hit or will be safe and deal chip damage on block.  

A good sample block string would be `2LK` > `2MK` > `236P/6P`. If this hits, cancel into  `236236K/46K`. If you want to get even more damage, instead cancel into `21416P/46P` ` into [Power Geyser Loops](#power-geyser-loops). A quick sample Power Geyser Loop might be `21416P/46P` > `214LP/4LP` > `21416P/46P` > etc.


### Recommended Decks

!!! tip "Infinity"
    - Solid and easy to activate Blue Gougi and extremely powerful Yellow Gougi makes this deck a no-brainer pick on any character, never mind Terry with his [Power Geyser Loops](#power-geyser-loops) and Level 3 supers.
    - Guard Cancel is a massive buff to Terry's Defense who can catch people out with a Back Spin Attack, Burn Knuckle or Rising Tackle.
    - Rage is a very nice bonus, allowing Terry to consistently push out [Power Geyser Loops](#power-geyser-loops) on any confirm.

## Move Analysis

### Notation

This guide uses Numpad notation. That means that directions correspond to the numbers on your keyboard numpad (ie. 6 is right, 4 is left, 8 s up, 2 is down). 5 means no direction held. For example, the classic Hadoken quartercircle motion would look like 236, the classic Tatsumaki/Hurricane Kick motion is 214 and the classic Shoryuken motion is 623. Flash Kick (Charging down then up) is [2]8.

For the special and super moves listed later on, the first input is the classic input, the second is the progressive input.

Cancel means you can do something else as soon as your first move hits IE. `2MK` on hit can go straight into a special move if you input the special move as `2MK` would hit. Special Cancel means you can cancel into Special Moves and Super Cancel means you can cancel into Super Moves.

Link means you have to let the move finish first before you can do another move. An example is `2MP` into `2MK` where 2MP has to completely start up, hit and recover before the 2MK can come out.

Lows are moves that have to be blocked crouching. Most crouching kicks hit low.

Mids are moves that can blocked either crouching or standing. Almost all standing moves, special moves, supers and crouching punches hit mid.

Highs/overheads are moves that must be blocked standing. Most jumping attacks and all Hard Attacks (`MP + MK`) hit high/overhead.

FEXL runs at 60 frames per second, so 1 frame is a 60th of a second. 2 frames would be 1/30th etc.

Startup means how long it takes for the move to actually hit.

Active means how long the move will actually hit for before recovering. The more active frames the better as a rule.

S.blo stands for standing block. In this case, it shows the difference in time between you recovering from your attack and the opponent recovering from blocking your attack. If it's 0, you both recover and can act at the same time. If it's -1 or lower, the opponent recovers faster and can act before you. If it's 1 or higher, you recover faster and can act before the opponent.

C.blo is similar but when the opponent crouch blocks instead.

## Gameplan
### Neutral

What are the character's pokes?

Do they have a fireball game? Do their specials have application in the neutral? (IE. Allen's fireball game, D.Dark's EXplosives and Dark Wire)

How do they antiair?

How is their mobility? Are they fast? Is their jump arc notable?

### Offense
### Mix-Ups

High-low mixups? Do they focus more on frame traps or tickthrows? Any left-right mix up? Do they have a solid throw game? Do any gougis they take give them mix up options?

### Set-Ups

!!! quote "Some move that knocks down into another move"
    Is this a chip setup? Is it for oki/vortex?

### Frame-Traps

!!! quote "Any Delayed Chain"
    As there is always a big window for you to chain one move to a higher strength, essentially any button can become a frame trap by simply delaying the next button just enough to allow a gap for an opponent to press a button that'll then get hit by your delayed button before their move can start up.
    
    The easiest way of practicing this by setting the training dummy to "After First Hit" and Guard All (Standing) or Guard All (Crouching), and setting either `5LP` or `2LP` in a slot for "Recording Settings (After Guard).
    
    The dummy will try to jab their way out of any gaps and if you've delayed correctly, you'll hit the dummy out of the startup of their jab. `2MP` or `2MK` are great normals to try and frame trap from.

!!! quote "Some normal > Other normal or special"
    Specific examples.



### Defense
Does your character have anything interesting outside of the normal defensive routes (it's good to note normal defense regardless). Do they just have to hold pressure or can they worm their way out? Do they take any decks that help them with defense (Guard cancel etc.)

### Reversals

Do they have wising dwagon (also all supers have invuln as well I guess)

### Escapes

Is your character particularly good for getting out? Teleports for example? Any Gougi that helps?

---

## Character Specific Techniques
## Combos

All characters can chain from a normal to a higher strength normal, either punch or kick. Chains work off cancels, meaning that the button doesn't have to finish its animation and can go immediately to the next normal. When links are mentioned, that means the normal HAS to finish and then you can get the next normal to come out. These tend to be harder. Unique/command normals chain from any normal.

### Bread And Butter Combos

(Note: Almost all of these strings will work from jump in starters.)

#### Universal Strings

!!! quote "2/5LK > 2/5MK > 2HK"
    A nice, safe(?) and fairly rewarding chain as it scores you a knockdown and works off your standing or crouching kicks.

!!! quote "2/5LK > 2/5MK > Command Normal > (Special/Super)"
    A slightly more risky string as Command Normal is poor on block.

!!! quote "2/5LK > 2/5MK > Special > Super"
    A nice and beginner friendly combo. Drop the combo at the special.    

#### Dash-In combos

!!! quote "2MP > 2MP > 2MK > Special/Command Normal > ([Power Geyser Loop](#powergeyserloops)/ Other Super)"
    The momentum from your dash allows you to link (Not chain, so timing is a lot more strict) a second `2MP` which can then link into `2MK`.
    
    This is definitely more difficular than your chains and on blocks there's fairly noticeable gaps that the opponent can jab through. Mix it up with cancelling your `2MP`s into `Something`.
    
    A very respectable punish combo against very unsafe moves like Rising Dragons or many blocked supers.

### Hit-Confirms

!!! quote "2LK> 2MK > Command normal > Whatever"
    If `command normal` will be blocked, it's better to go into `X` or `Y` instead.

!!! quote "Whatever > Special"
    Special is safe on block or chips or whatever.

### Anti-Air Conversions

!!! quote "AntiAir Normal > Super / Special"
    Does Range matter? Is it an immediate cancel?

### Air to Air Conversions

!!! quote "j.MK/HK > Special / Super"
    Is this Height dependent? Do you need to land?


### Power Geyser Loops

!!! quote "Whatever > Super > Combo Filler > Super > Combo Filler > Super > Combo Ender"
    Any particular input tricks? How does hitstun decay affect the later part of the combos?

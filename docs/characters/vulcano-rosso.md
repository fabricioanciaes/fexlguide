## Brief Overview
### Type of Character

Vulcano Russo is a rushdown/vortex character with a somewhat unorthodox kit. He has access to a slow short-ranged multi-hit fireball, a command dash, a command short hop, a simple rekka series and 2 different kinds of counter moves. He lacks Unique Normals aside from Hard Attack and has some strange normals, making his strings slightly different. His damage is somewhat low and isn't able to dump his meter into high damage like some other characters. Despite this, he has THE best vortex in the game and fantastic mixup, causing him to keep the pressure on opponents even after they get up and can often open the opponent back up and starting his vortex all over again. Vulcano Rosso is the character to play if you like being able to put the other character into a blender, forcing the opponent to try and block both Low/Overhead and left/right, and playing with a eclectic selection of Special Moves.

!!! success "Strengths"
    - Extremely strong vortex that can lead back into itself.
    - Superb mix up with his command dash and command short hop, allows him to convert his pressure into a full combo. - Strong anti-air normals with fairly decent conversions 
    
!!! failure "Weaknesses"
    - Somewhat low damage even with meter, struggles to cash in more than one bar of meter in a combo.
    - No real fireball game, forcing him to be up close to get anything done - Right pain in the arse to refer to his move by their actual names.


### 5 Minute Guide

(if you don't know what the abbreviations mean, check the [notation](#notation) guide below.)

Take Shinobi as your deck, if you can activate its gougi will let you turn invisible, make your Hard Attack (MP+MK) unblockable and lets you do Specials and Supers out of blockstun. To quickly activate Ghost, keep the opponent away for 12 seconds at the start of the match with 214P

2LK, 2MP, 2MK, 5HK are all good buttons to poke with.

If someone is jumping in on you, either do 5MK or 2HP. If you land either of these as an antiair, 214214P is a good way of getting damage to score a knockdown.

For jumping in, use j.MK as it does 2 hits.

For combos, start off with light kicks or punches, move up to medium kicks or punches and then to hard kicks or punches. Easiest one is 2LK > 2MK > 2HK.

If your combo lands, as long as you haven't done 2HK yet you can do 236P, and then follow up with P and K immediately afterwards to a second punch and a kick, sending the opponent flying to the corner. If you have a bar of Meter, do the second punch and then cancel to 214214P.

If the opponent is knocked down, either close the gap with 236K, or do 214P (ideally the MP or HP version) to force the opponent to block as they get up. You can also mix it up with PP (a short hop that lets you hit overhead extremely quickly with K) and 214HK to zip past the opponent along with the usual low hitting moves and throws to open up the opponent. If you can open them up, try to combo so that you put them right back in the same situation.

For the most part you can ignore his counters. The KK counter lets you stop a projectile and do a quick dash attack that can be cancelled into a super like 236236K or 236236P.

The best combo to learn immediately is 2LK > 2MK > 236P > P > K or instead do 2LK > 2MK > 236P > P > 214214P if you have the meter.



### Recommended Decks

!!! tip "Shinobi"
    - Very solid Blue Gougi granting him an 5% damage increase and 10% speed increase almost immediately into the match.
    - Guard Cancel as always is a fantastic defensive Gougi. Vulcano Rosso struggles to spend meter as is, so doesn't mind spending the bar either on his Rage of Vesuvio or his counters, Umiliazione Di Canossa.
    - Guard Break allows Vulcano Russo to set up difficult to escape unblockable situations and get huge rewards. Doesn't quite get to land the Hard Attacks for free like D.Dark does, but is still not too bad at sneaking them in. - Ghost makes approaching much easier for Vulcano Russo, allowing him to start enforcing his pressure and vortex much more reliably. Once he's in, a quick dash makes his mixup even scarier and unpredictable. Is also fairly good at stalling for the 12 seconds needed to Trigger the Ghost with his 214P which is pretty good at preventing the opponent from rushing in.

## Move Analysis

### Notation

This guide uses Numpad notation. That means that directions correspond to the numbers on your keyboard numpad (ie. 6 is right, 4 is left, 8 s up, 2 is down). 5 means no direction held. For example, the classic Hadoken quartercircle motion would look like 236, the classic Tatsumaki/Hurricane Kick motion is 214 and the classic Shoryuken motion is 623.

For the special and super moves listed later on, the first input is the classic input, the second is the progressive input.

Cancel means you can do something else as soon as your first move hits IE. `2MK` on hit can go straight into a special move if you input the special move as `2MK` would hit. Special Cancel means you can cancel into Special Moves and Super Cancel means you can cancel into Super Moves.

Link means you have to let the move finish first before you can do another move. An example is `2MP` into `2MK` where 2MP has to completely start up, hit and recover before the 2MK can come out.

Lows are moves that have to be blocked crouching. Most crouching kicks hit low.

Mids are moves that can blocked either crouching or standing. Almost all standing moves, special moves, supers and crouching punches hit mid.

Highs/overheads are moves that must be blocked standing. Most jumping attacks and all Hard Attacks (`MP + MK`) hit high/overhead.

FEXL runs at 60 frames per second, so 1 frame is a 60th of a second. 2 frames would be 1/30th etc.

Startup means how long it takes for the move to actually hit.

Active means how long the move will actually hit for before recovering. The more active frames the better as a rule.

S.blo stands for standing block. In this case, it shows the difference in time between you recovering from your attack and the opponent recovering from blocking your attack. If it's 0, you both recover and can act at the same time. If it's -1 or lower, the opponent recovers faster and can act before you. If it's 1 or higher, you recover faster and can act before the opponent.

C.blo is similar but when the opponent crouch blocks instead.

This is the cornerstone of Vulcano Rosso's pressure and vortex. While it can't be used the same way a normal fire ball can, it's fantastic to use on knocked down opponents and basically lets you mix up the opponent for completely free as they're stuck blocking the Vulcanus.

The strength of the punch determines the startup and distance the first hit travels. This is the special you want to combo into. Doing the full command is your best meterless option, but if you have 1 bar of meter, it's well worth Super Cancelling into Torre Pendente Di Pisa (214214P) after the second P to allow you to dash forward and apply Vortex as the opponent is still flying after you recover from the Super. The first command is somewhat unsafe on block, with the next 2 becoming much more unsafe, so make sure you stop doing the command if the first hit is blocked. Notably, you can cancel this Special into your counter, Umiliazione Di Canossa and potentially catch the punish attempt from the opponent.</td>

The the Mid and Overhead counter can be followed up with by a normal (use 2MP or 2MK) allowing for some decent damage. The Low counter does an special counter attack that cannot be followed up on. This takes some time to start up, so it's a pretty bad idea to do as you're getting up as any proper meaty attempt will beat it out.</td>

However, for setting up vortex Torre Pendente Di Pisa is much better as it sends the opponent the perfect distance off an aerial hit which is easily combo'd into from the second hit of Rage of Vesuvio, so this is usually better if you cannot get the opponent off the ground during a combo (IE. You've ended your chain in a heavy attack). Probably the best super to use as a reversal.</td>

A semi decent anti-air but really finds its niche as the best super to use on opponents that have been sent into the air by another anti-air or air-to air or combo. If instantly cancelled into from the second hti of Rage of Vesuvio, it sends the opponent spiralling upwards at the perfect height to easily follow up on from anywhere on the screen. This becomes even better in the corner, and is probably what you'll be spending your bar on along with any Gougi that use it, like Stealth Raptor. Not great for going into other supers, but Rosso doesn't really have a good sequence of supers to do in a combo anyway.</td>

Unfortunately, this really leads to very lackluster damage (62 damage going from Accelerando to Ponte Dei Sospiri back to Accelerando, very poor for 3 bars.) and you're probably best keeping your meter. </td>

## Gameplan
### Neutral

What are the character's pokes?

Do they have a fireball game? Do their specials have application in the neutral? (IE. Allen's fireball game, D.Dark's EXplosives and Dark Wire)

How do they antiair?

How is their mobility? Are they fast? Is their jump arc notable?

### Offense
### Mix-Ups

High-low mixups? Do they focus more on frame traps or tickthrows? Any left-right mix up? Do they have a solid throw game? Do any gougis they take give them mix up options?

### Set-Ups

!!! quote "Some move that knocks down into another move"
    Is this a chip setup? Is it for oki/vortex?

### Frame-Traps

!!! quote "Any Delayed Chain"
    As there is always a big window for you to chain one move to a higher strength, essentially any button can become a frame trap by simply delaying the next button just enough to allow a gap for an opponent to press a button that'll then get hit by your delayed button before their move can start up.
    
    The easiest way of practicing this by setting the training dummy to "After First Hit" and Guard All (Standing) or Guard All (Crouching), and setting either `5LP` or `2LP` in a slot for "Recording Settings (After Guard).
    
    The dummy will try to jab their way out of any gaps and if you've delayed correctly, you'll hit the dummy out of the startup of their jab. `2MP` or `2MK` are great normals to try and frame trap from.

!!! quote "Some normal > Other normal or special"
    Specific examples.



### Defense
Does your character have anything interesting outside of the normal defensive routes (it's good to note normal defense regardless). Do they just have to hold pressure or can they worm their way out? Do they take any decks that help them with defense (Guard cancel etc.)

### Reversals

Do they have wising dwagon (also all supers have invuln as well I guess)

### Escapes

Is your character particularly good for getting out? Teleports for example? Any Gougi that helps?

---

## Character Specific Techniques
## Combos

All characters can chain from a normal to a higher strength normal, either punch or kick. Chains work off cancels, meaning that the button doesn't have to finish its animation and can go immediately to the next normal. When links are mentioned, that means the normal HAS to finish and then you can get the next normal to come out. These tend to be harder. Unique/command normals chain from any normal.

### Bread And Butter Combos

(Note: Almost all of these strings will work from jump in starters.)

#### Universal Strings

!!! quote "2/5LK > 2/5MK > 2HK"
    A nice, safe(?) and fairly rewarding chain as it scores you a knockdown and works off your standing or crouching kicks.

!!! quote "2/5LK > 2/5MK > Command Normal > (Special/Super)"
    A slightly more risky string as Command Normal is poor on block.

!!! quote "2/5LK > 2/5MK > Special > Super"
    A nice and beginner friendly combo. Drop the combo at the special.    

#### Dash-In combos

!!! quote "2MP > 2MP > 2MK > Special/Command Normal > ([Example Super Loop](#examplesuperloops)/ Other Super)"
    The momentum from your dash allows you to link (Not chain, so timing is a lot more strict) a second `2MP` which can then link into `2MK`.
    
    This is definitely more difficular than your chains and on blocks there's fairly noticeable gaps that the opponent can jab through. Mix it up with cancelling your `2MP`s into `Something`.
    
    A very respectable punish combo against very unsafe moves like Rising Dragons or many blocked supers.

### Hit-Confirms

!!! quote "2LK> 2MK > Command normal > Whatever"
    If `command normal` will be blocked, it's better to go into `X` or `Y` instead.

!!! quote "Whatever > Special"
    Special is safe on block or chips or whatever.

### Anti-Air Conversions

!!! quote "AntiAir Normal > Super / Special"
    Does Range matter? Is it an immediate cancel?

### Air to Air Conversions

!!! quote "j.MK/HK > Special / Super"
    Is this Height dependent? Do you need to land?


### Example Super Loop

!!! quote "Whatever > Super > Combo Filler > Super > Combo Filler > Super > Combo Ender"
    Any particular input tricks? How does hitstun decay affect the later part of the combos?

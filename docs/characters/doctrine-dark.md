## Brief Overview
### Type of Character

Doctrine Dark is a fairly unorthodox character that both plays lame and zone-y, but also can pull off powerful mixups and setups up close. A combination of wires and mines allow him to zone out the opponent very easily but also let him get full combos off any confirm. While he suffers from poor damage and some bad normals, Doctrine Dark dictates the pace of each match and frustrates the other player into making bad decisions which he can fully capitalize on.


!!! success "Strengths"
    - Surprisingly strong zoning with his Dark Wire, Dark Defender and EX-Plosive, shutting down many approachs from both air and ground. - Dark Wire can be both combo'd out of and into, making it a great combo starter and combo linker. - Dark Defender allows for fairly easy conversions as an anti-air - With the right gougi, can easily play both very defensively and very offensively, switching as needed. - Fantastic setups if D.Dark gets the knockdown, even allowing him to get unblockables with the right setup and Gougi.

!!! failure "Weaknesses"
    - Has quite a few stubby normals, making his strings fairly awkward and limited
    - Very low damage even with meter, making him a poor comeback character - Doesn't have particularly good ways of spending all his meter in a combo. - No meterless reversals, and his metered reversals aren't great either. - Fairly technical and doesn't have as many easy rewarding combo routes as other characters

### 5 Minute Guide

(if you don't know what the abbreviations mean, check the [notation](#notation) guide below.)

Take Shinobi as your deck, D.Dark can easily lame out the opponent for 12 seconds at the start of the match to get Ghost Triggered, letting you turn invisible when you dash. You also get Guard Cancel, which lets you do Specials and Supers out of blockstun. 

`2MP`, `2LK`, `2MK` and `5LK` are decent pokes.

Zone out the opponent with `EX-Plosive` and `Dark Wire` (236P). This'll often force them to jump. If they land or walk into `EX-Plosive`, it's often a free combo and even from faraway you can catch them with `Dark Wire`

If someone is jumping in on you, either do `5HK` or `2HP`. Super Cancel into `Dark Knife` (236236P) if you get the hit. D.Dark can instead use `Dark Defender` (623P) and juggle into `5HK`/`2HP` > `Dark Knife`.

For jump-ins, stick to `j.MK`. This is also your crossup jump-in normal.

D.Dark has some particularly awkward normals, so for chains stick to `2LK` > `2MK` > `2HK`. The `2HK` is completely safe so feel free to end blockstrings with it.

If your chain hits, instead of `2HK`, you can either do `6MK` > `Dark Shackle` (236236K) or go from the `2MK` into `Dark Wire` (236P).

When you hit with `Dark Wire`, pull them in by doing `Dark Hold` (4P). If you want to activate G.Break by doing `Hard Attack` (MP + MK), you can easily do `Hard Attack` > `Dark Knife`. Otherwise, quickly dash forward (66) and immediately do `5LK` > `5MK` > `5HK` > `Dark Knife`.

If the opponent is knocked down,Put a `EX-Plosive` on top or in front of them as they get up. Mix it up with his `2LK`/`2MK`, normal throws, `Hard Attack` and cross-up `j.MK` along with any gougi-specific mixups such as Hunting or Guard Break.

## Move Analysis

### Notation

This guide uses Numpad notation. That means that directions correspond to the numbers on your keyboard numpad (ie. 6 is right, 4 is left, 8 s up, 2 is down). 5 means no direction held. For example, the classic Hadoken quartercircle motion would look like 236, the classic Tatsumaki/Hurricane Kick motion is 214 and the classic Shoryuken motion is 623.

For the special and super moves listed later on, the first input is the classic input, the second is the progressive input.

Cancel means you can do something else as soon as your first move hits IE. `2MK` on hit can go straight into a special move if you input the special move as `2MK` would hit. Special Cancel means you can cancel into Special Moves and Super Cancel means you can cancel into Super Moves.

Link means you have to let the move finish first before you can do another move. An example is `2MP` into `2MK` where 2MP has to completely start up, hit and recover before the 2MK can come out.

Lows are moves that have to be blocked crouching. Most crouching kicks hit low.

Mids are moves that can blocked either crouching or standing. Almost all standing moves, special moves, supers and crouching punches hit mid.

Highs/overheads are moves that must be blocked standing. Most jumping attacks and all Hard Attacks (`MP + MK`) hit high/overhead.

FEXL runs at 60 frames per second, so 1 frame is a 60th of a second. 2 frames would be 1/30th etc.

Startup means how long it takes for the move to actually hit.

Active means how long the move will actually hit for before recovering. The more active frames the better as a rule.

S.blo stands for standing block. In this case, it shows the difference in time between you recovering from your attack and the opponent recovering from blocking your attack. If it's 0, you both recover and can act at the same time. If it's -1 or lower, the opponent recovers faster and can act before you. If it's 1 or higher, you recover faster and can act before the opponent.

C.blo is similar but when the opponent crouch blocks instead.

    <td>As per most command normals this can be chained into from any other normal and is super cancellable only. From a full chain into `Death Spinkick`, the best super to cancel into is `Dark Shackle` (236236K/46K) which leads to roughly 70 damage which is pretty decent for a bar of meter. However,  Dark Wire confirms from strings are generally more safe, reliable and can potentially lead to more damage. Specific interactions with Gougi (IE. landing 4 Hard Attacks) also make Dark Wire routes generally the better option. Feel free to use `Death Spinkick` if you want a clean way to end the round and you only have 1 bar of meter to work.</td>

    <td><b>Knife Nightmare(4MP)</b></td>
    <td>A faster overhead than Hard Attack but is neither special or super cancellable and is actually 0 on hit, meaning the opponent gets to act the same time you do. It can be chained into from any normal like `Death Spinkick`, so it can be used to insert a surprise overhead into chains. Given its shorter reach, this should be relegated to dash-in chains. As it's unsafe and there's no option of super cancelling to catch a punish, this is a move you should only throw out once or twice a match. </td>

<tr>
    <td><b>Shudder Blade (Hard Attack, MP+MK)</b></td>
    <td>D.Dark's universal overhead. As always, massively unsafe on block but is super cancellable and keeps them grounded on hit which allows him to get decent damage off a `Dark Shackle`. Can be combo'd into from a Dark Wire confirm and then into `Dark Knife` which is what allows D.Dark to get the Guard Break gougi Triggered easier than any other character. Has a strange interaction with `EX-plosive`, causing it to instantly go off as `Shudder Blade` starts up. Most likely intended to prevent easy unblockable setups.</td>

    <td>D.Dark sends out a wire that destroys projectiles and if it hits a grounded opponent, will latch onto them, allowing you to do `Dark Spark` or `Dark Hold`. The strength of the punch affects how far the wire will go. `Dark Hold` is almost always the better option, allowing you to pull the opponent in and extend your combo, Mortal Kombat's Scorpion style. Almost all of your grounded combos should lead in this move, and there's several extensions that are worth learning.</td>

A few things to note is that it is a fixed distance, so certain combos (particularly combos involving j.HK as a starter) may need to be adjusted to still land. Also, the opponent is in a special state that means they won't be grounded after being hit. This prevents you from just doing yet another regular combo back into Dark Wire, but does still allow decent followups. Check the combo section below to figure out your followups. </td>

If it hits an airborne opponent raw, it'll send them into a slow descending spiral. Otherwise, it'll knock them up slightly instead and cannot be followed up on except with a Super Cancel into `Dark Knife`. As a result, it's not a combo extension tool like `Dark Wire` but is an excellent anti-air combo starter. Use this to catch out obvious jump-ins, especially when the opponent is trying to get over a `EX-plosive`.</td>

The strength of the kick determines how long it takes for the bomb to go off. Along with `Dark Wire`, this is D.Dark's main zoning tool, but is also used for many of his setups. Unless the bomb hits the opponent before it even gets to the ground, a hit can easily be followed up on. This is both good for catching people jumping or walking into it in neutral and using it as a meaty on a knocked down opponent. A regular `2LK` > `2MK` > etc. combo will work as normal off a successful bomb hit.</td>

## Gameplan
### Neutral

D.Dark doesn't have too many pokes given that a lot of his standing normals are very close ranged elbow and knee strikes. Use `2LK`, `2MK` and `2MP` as your general normal pokes. 

D.Dark instead shines in neutral through use of his `Dark Wire`, dark blah blah blah

How do they antiair?

How is their mobility? Are they fast? Is their jump arc notable?

### Offense
### Mix-Ups

High-low mixups? Do they focus more on frame traps or tickthrows? Any left-right mix up? Do they have a solid throw game? Do any gougis they take give them mix up options?

### Set-Ups

!!! quote "Some move that knocks down into another move"
    Is this a chip setup? Is it for oki/vortex?

### Frame-Traps

!!! quote "Any Delayed Chain"
    As there is always a big window for you to chain one move to a higher strength, essentially any button can become a frame trap by simply delaying the next button just enough to allow a gap for an opponent to press a button that'll then get hit by your delayed button before their move can start up.
    
    The easiest way of practicing this by setting the training dummy to "After First Hit" and Guard All (Standing) or Guard All (Crouching), and setting either `5LP` or `2LP` in a slot for "Recording Settings (After Guard).
    
    The dummy will try to jab their way out of any gaps and if you've delayed correctly, you'll hit the dummy out of the startup of their jab. `2MP` or `2MK` are great normals to try and frame trap from.

!!! quote "Some normal > Other normal or special"
    Specific examples.



### Defense
Does your character have anything interesting outside of the normal defensive routes (it's good to note normal defense regardless). Do they just have to hold pressure or can they worm their way out? Do they take any decks that help them with defense (Guard cancel etc.)

### Reversals

Do they have wising dwagon (also all supers have invuln as well I guess)

### Escapes

Is your character particularly good for getting out? Teleports for example? Any Gougi that helps?

## Character Specific Techniques
## Combos

All characters can chain from a normal to a higher strength normal, either punch or kick. Chains work off cancels, meaning that the button doesn't have to finish its animation and can go immediately to the next normal. When links are mentioned, that means the normal HAS to finish and then you can get the next normal to come out. These tend to be harder. Unique/command normals chain from any normal.

### Bread And Butter Combos

(Note: Almost all of these strings will work from jump in starters.)

#### Universal Strings

!!! quote "2/5LK > 2/5MK > 2HK"
    A nice, safe(?) and fairly rewarding chain as it scores you a knockdown and works off your standing or crouching kicks.

!!! quote "2/5LK > 2/5MK > Command Normal > (Special/Super)"
    A slightly more risky string as Command Normal is poor on block.

!!! quote "2/5LK > 2/5MK > Special > Super"
    A nice and beginner friendly combo. Drop the combo at the special.    

#### Dash-In combos

!!! quote "2MP > 2MP > 2MK > Special/Command Normal > ([Example Super Loop](#examplesuperloops)/ Other Super)"
    The momentum from your dash allows you to link (Not chain, so timing is a lot more strict) a second `2MP` which can then link into `2MK`.
    
    This is definitely more difficular than your chains and on blocks there's fairly noticeable gaps that the opponent can jab through. Mix it up with cancelling your `2MP`s into `Something`.
    
    A very respectable punish combo against very unsafe moves like Rising Dragons or many blocked supers.

### Hit-Confirms

!!! quote "2LK> 2MK > Command normal > Whatever"
    If `command normal` will be blocked, it's better to go into `X` or `Y` instead.

!!! quote "Whatever > Special"
    Special is safe on block or chips or whatever.

### Anti-Air Conversions

!!! quote "AntiAir Normal > Super / Special"
    Does Range matter? Is it an immediate cancel?

### Air to Air Conversions

!!! quote "j.MK/HK > Special / Super"
    Is this Height dependent? Do you need to land?


### Example Super Loop

!!! quote "Whatever > Super > Combo Filler > Super > Combo Filler > Super > Combo Ender"
    Any particular input tricks? How does hitstun decay affect the later part of the combos?

## Brief Overview
### Type of Character
Allen is a shotokan style character with a bit of a twist. His solid fireball and Dragon Punch (well, Rising Dragon) and generally good normals are supplemented with relatively easy and damaging loops using his Triple Break super to launch the opponent over and over as long as he has the meter. His command grab and Justice Fist, a super cancellable and high damaging move that's otherwise negative on hit(!) rounds him out and in general is a incredibly solid and accessible character. 

### 5 Minute Guide

(if you don't know what the abbreviations mean, check the notation guide below.)

Take Infinity as your deck, lets you gain 130% meter almost immediately, after doing 10 supers you get a rapidly regenerating super bar

2LK, 2MP, 2MK, 5LK, 5MK are all good buttons to poke with. 236P is a nice fireball.

If someone is jumping in on you, either do 5HK or 623P. You can do 623P as you're getting up if someone is trying to hit you, you'll get combo'd for free if it's blocked.

For combos, start off with light kicks or punches, move up to medium kicks or punches and then to hard kicks or punches. Easiest one is 2LK > 2MK > 2HK.

If your combo lands, as long as you haven't done 2HK yet you can do 6MK and then immediately do 236236P to get a fireball super. This'll deal about 20% of their health in damage.

If you do 236236K instead of 236236P in combos, you can catch the opponent on the way down with 421K and immediately do 236236K again. You can do this over and over as long as you have the meter. When you've done your last 236236K do 623P instead of 421K so that they can't hit you while Allen keeps posing.




!!! success "Strengths"
    - His projectile (Soul Force, 236P) and dragon punch (Rising Dragon, 623P) allows  for solid "Super Turbo" style play by zoning out the opponent with fireballs and catching their jumps with the uppercut move.

    - Decent chip options with both Soul Force and Fire Force without having to use Gougi such as Berserker

    - Can consistently turn confirms into high damage with Triple Break loops, allowing him to easily cash out damage from his meter.

    - Has both a dragon punch and his 5HK for anti airing

    - Decent normals in general

    - His fireball game allows him to generate meter in the neutral very well.


!!! failure "Weaknesses"
    - Somewhat low damage without meter
    - Has a few underwhelming normals (mainly his heavy punches)
    - Many of his damaging options are unsafe and often fully punishable if they don't hit or are blocked.



### Recommended Decks

!!! tip "Infinity"
    - Allen really wants meter for his damage, which Infinity provides almost immediately with its 3 Meter Ups
    - Guard Cancel is generally solid anyway, but Allen has both a strong combo starter with Justice Fist and a reversal with Rising Dragon to punish people's blockstrings and pressure
    - Rage is a very nice bonus, allowing Allen to consistently get full Triple Break Loops in the later rounds.

## Move Analysis

### Notation

This guide uses Numpad notation. That means that directions correspond to the numbers on your keyboard numpad (ie. 6 is right, 4 is left, 8 s up, 2 is down). 5 means no direction held. For example, the classic Hadoken quartercircle motion would look like 236, the classic Tatsumaki/Hurricane Kick motion is 214 and the classic Shoryuken motion is 623.

LK = Light Kick

MK = Medium Kick

HK = Heavy Kick

LP = Light Punch

MP = Medium Punch

HP = Heavy Punch

MP + MK = Press both MP and MK at the same time.

For special moves, the first input is the classic input, the second is the progressive input.

Cancel means you can do something else as soon as your first move hits IE. 2MK on hit can go straight into a special move if you input the special move as 2MK would hit. Special Cancel means you can cancel into Special Moves and Super Cancel means you can cancel into Super Moves.

Link means you have to let the move finish first before you can do another move.

Lows are moves that have to be blocked crouching. Most crouching kicks hit low.

Mids are moves that can blocked either crouching or standing. Almost all standing moves, special moves, supers and crouching punches hit mid.

Highs/overheads are moves that must be blocked standing. Most jumping attacks and all Hard Attacks (MP + MK) hit high/overhead.

Startup means how long it takes for the move to actually hit.

S.blo stands for standing block. In this case, it shows the difference in time between you recovering from your attack and the opponent recovering from blocking your attack. If it's 0, you both recover and can act at the same time. If it's -1 or lower, the opponent recovers faster and can act before you. If it's 1 or higher, you recover faster and can act before the opponent.

C.blo is similar but when the opponent crouch blocks instead.

Super cancels which allows for confirms into Fire Force or even start a Triple Break loop. 

Generally safe at long ranges but be wary of using it in blockstrings, as upclose it is outright punishable on block. Soul Force has decent pushback midscreen but will not pushback in the corner. </td>

The strength of the button determines the length Allen travels.

While it does destroy fireballs, it should only be used in combos since it's way too dangerous to  miss. Fantastic combo filler, don't use it to end combos if you can help it, especially in the corner.</td>

Fairly fast, can potentially be used to beat out other projectiles in a fireball war. Similarly to Soul Force, it becomes much more unsafe in the corner as it relies on pushback to keep you safe. </td>

It's not difficult to learn practical combos that can lead to using all 3 bars of super on Triple Break. The speed and hitbox of Triple Break also allows for some cheeky conversions, making Allen incredibly explosive.

A sample beginner combo may be 2LK 2MK 6MK Triple Break > Justice Fist > Triple Break > Justice Fist > Triple Break > Rising Dragon. </td>

## Gameplan
### Neutral

Allen has a selection of decent pokes, with his 5 LK, 5MK, 2MP and 2MK being the most useful. These buttons also can easily combo into 2HK or even 6MK into Triple Break or Fire Force, allowing him to cash out damage from his far reaching normals. 2HK by itself is great for its knockdown but is very bad to whiff given its long recovery.

Allen also has a very solid fireball game allowing him to chip the opponent out and zone them. If they attempt to get around it with jumping, his Rising Dragon and 5HK allow him to knock the opponent out of the sky. His LP soul force in particular allows him to both control space and even let him run in very safely.

Allen's fast walk speed and run speed allows him to quickly get ground on the opponent and lets him get his pokes into range.

### Offense
### Mix-Ups

Allen doesn't have overhead normals or specials apart from MP+MK, so Allen relies on frame traps and tick throws along with his command grab to open a turtling opponent. His solid crossup kick also lets him get some left-right mixup on opponents recovering from a knockdown. Allen's solid chip options also means that it is no big loss for his strings to be blocked.

### Set-Ups

!!! quote "Vaulting Kick into Fire Force"
    Simple chip option from fullscreen, sadly you don't get time for much of a runup before the opponent recovers.

### Frame-Traps

!!! quote "Any Delayed Chain"
As there is always a big window for you to chain one move to a higher strength, essentially any button can become a frame trap by simply delaying the next button just enough to allow a gap for an opponent to press a button that'll then get hit by your delayed button before their move can start up. The easiest way of practicing this by setting the training dummy to "After First Hit" and Guard All (Standing) or Guard All (Crouching), and setting either 5LP or 2LP in a slot for "Recording Settings (After Guard). The dummy will try to jab their way out of any gaps and if you've delayed correctly, you'll hit the dummy out of the startup of their jab. 2MP or 2MK are great normals to try and frame trap from.

!!! quote "2MK/2MP > Soul Force"
    Both these normals unchained have a gap that can be beaten out by 5f startup moves, Soul Foce will catch these normals and as it super cancels can start Triple Break loops. 5HP works as well, sadly 5HP still whiffs on some characters if they keep blocking while crouched, including Allen himself (Maybe a full list? Definitely works on D. Dark.) Justice Fist actually works if you feel like being a man and/or being at least -79 if you guess wrong.



### Defense

Outside of the usual defense options, Allen does have Rising Dragon to potentially worm his way out of gaps in the opponent's pressure.
Guard cancel allows him to Justice Fist his way out of pressure, making for an excellent combo starter 

### Reversals

The netplay classic DP lives on in Rising Dragon and it's usually just as bad of an idea. Fire Force is somewhat decent as it is much less punishable than a blocked Rising Dragon.

### Escapes

---

## Character Specific Techniques
## Combos

As per all characters, Allen can chain from a normal to a higher strength normal, either punch or kick. Chains work off cancels, meaning that the button doesn't have to finish its animation and can go immediately to the next normal. When links are mentioned, that means the normal HAS to finish and then you can get the next normal to come out. These tend to be harder. His 6MK chains from every other normal.

### Bread And Butter Combos

(Note: Almost all of these strings will work from a j.MK jumpin starter too.)

#### Universal Strings

!!! quote "2/5LK > 2/5MK > 2HK"
    A nice, safe and fairly rewarding chain as it scores you a knockdown and works off your standing or crouching kicks.

!!! quote "2/5LK > 2/5MK > (5HK) > 6MK > (Triple Break Loop/ Fire Force)"
    A slightly more risky string as 6MK is poor on block. If the opponent is definitely standing, feel free to put the 5HK in for the extra damage.
    
    If the 6MK connects, rev up your Triple Break loop.

!!! quote "Whatever > Triple Break > Justice Fist > Triple Break > Justice Fist > Triple Break > Rising Dragon"
    A nice and beginner friendly loop. While the individual parts are dangerous to drop, it is fairly easy to pull off regardless.
    
    It's extremely important to not end the combo with Justice Fist, especially in the corner (and you will be in the corner, as this combo has fantastic corner carry.)

#### Dash-In combos

!!! quote "2MP > 2MP > 2MK > Soul Force/6MK > (Triple Break Loop/ Fire Force)"
    The momentum from your dash allows you to link (Not chain, so timing is a lot more strict) a second 2MP which can then link into 2MK.
    
    This is definitely more difficular than your chains and on blocks there's fairly noticeable gaps that the opponent can jab through. Mix it up with cancelling your 2MPs into Soul Force to frame trap them.
    
    A very respectable punish combo against very unsafe moves like Rising Dragons or many blocked supers.

### Hit-Confirms

!!! quote "2LK> 2MK > 6MK > Whatever"
    If 6MK will be blocked, it's better to go into Soul Force or 2HK instead.

!!! quote "Whatever > Soul Force"
    Soul Force is both a decent blockstring ender and can go into both Fire Force or Triple Break, making it a no-brainer to cancel into from a chain of normals for the most part. Soul Force becomes way more unsafe in the corner however

### Anti-Air Conversions

!!! quote "5HK Triple Break"
    This allows Allen to potentially deal 50%+ off antiairs using a Triple Break Loop. Annoyingly, this can easily drop off max range 5HK connects, making it pretty risky to confirm.

!!! quote "5HK Fire Force"
    A less rewarding but much less unsafe super cancel. Depending on how you hit it, may just deal 1 hit or get the full 5 hits. If you have the spare meter, this is a pretty safe way of squeezing out extra damage.


### Air to Air Conversions

!!! quote "j.MK/HK > Triple Break"
    Allen sadly lacks any aerial specials or supers to really get 100% reliable aerial conversions.
    
    Depending on both your height and the opponent's height, you can fairly often get Triple Break to catch them as they fall.
    
    As a rule, if you hit them as you're on your way up your jump, you'll probably not land in time for the Triple Break.

!!! quote "j.MK/HK > 5HK"

5HK will fairly often catch the opponent similarly to Triple Break but way less dangerous if it misses.

!!! quote "j.MK/HK > Justice Fist > Triple Break"

Despite how dangerous the Justice Fist is to whiff, it actually works fairly reliably. The HP version of Justice Fist can often go under people and whiff, definitely practice this in training on a jumping opponent to get a feel for it. If you can land this, you can do 50% damage very easily off a basic full Triple Break Loop

### Triple Break Loops

!!! quote "Whatever > Triple Break > Justice Fist > Triple Break > Justice Fist > Triple Break > Rising Dragon"
    As mentioned early, this is the basic Triple Break loop. Will work anywhere on the screen and deal roughly 40% damage.

!!! quote "Whatever > Triple Break > 2MP > 5MK > Justice Fist > Triple Break > Justice Fist > Triple Break > Rising Dragon"

A slightly more optimal loop, corner only as 5MK will fall out midscreen. Sneaks in a bit more damage and also builds you more meter. Another corner variant is to do 5MP > 5HP > Justice Fist. Any of these extensions only work after the first Triple Break, just stick to Justice Fist after the 2nd or third Triple Breaks.

!!! quote "Whatever > Triple Break > 5HP > Justice Fist > Triple Break > Justice Fist > Triple Break > Rising Dragon"

Similar to the previous loop, but works midscreen.

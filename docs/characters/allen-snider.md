## Brief Overview

### Type of Character

Allen is a shotokan style character with a bit of a twist. His solid fireball and Dragon Punch (well, Rising Dragon) and generally good normals are supplemented with relatively easy and damaging loops using his Triple Break super to launch the opponent over and over as long as he has the meter. His command grab and Justice Fist, a super cancellable and high damaging move that's otherwise negative on hit(!) rounds him out and in general is a incredibly solid and accessible character. 

!!! success "Strengths"
    - His projectile (Soul Force, `236P`) and dragon punch (Rising Dragon, `623P`) allows  for solid "Super Turbo" style play by zoning out the opponent with fireballs and catching their jumps with Rising Dragon or his 5HK
    - Decent chip options with both Soul Force and Fire Force without having to use Gougi such as Berserker
    - Can consistently turn confirms into high damage with [Triple Break Loop](#triple-break-loops)s, allowing him to easily cash out damage from his meter
    - Has both a dragon punch (Rising Dragon) and his `5HK` for anti airing
    - Decent normals in general
    - Has a great meterless reversal with Rising Dragon
    - His fireball game allows him to generate meter in the neutral very well.

!!! failure "Weaknesses"
    - Somewhat low damage without meter
    - No real 100% guaranteed anti-air / air-to-air conversions, attempting to cash in more damage is a risk
    - Many of his damaging options are unsafe and often fully punishable if they don't hit or are blocked    
    - Reversal options are all unsafe or punishable, making them incredibly risky.

### 5 Minute Guide

(if you don't know what the abbreviations mean, check the [notation](#notation) guide below.)

Take Infinity as your deck, lets you gain 130% meter almost immediately, after doing 10 supers you get a rapidly regenerating super bar

`2LK`, `2MP`, `2MK`, `5LK`, `5MK` are all good buttons to poke with. `236P` is a nice fireball.

If someone is jumping in on you, either do `5HK` or `623P`. You can do `623P` as you're getting up if someone is trying to hit you, you'll get combo'd for free if it's blocked.

For combos, start off with light kicks or punches, move up to medium kicks or punches and then to hard kicks or punches. Easiest and most reliable one is `2LK > 2MK > 2HK`.

If your combo lands, as long as you haven't done `2HK` yet you can do `6MK` and then immediately do `236236P` to get a fireball super. This'll deal about 20% of their health in damage.

If you do `236236K` instead of `236236P` in combos, you can catch the opponent on the way down with `421P` and immediately do `236236K` again. You can do this over and over as long as you have the meter. When you've done your last `236236K` do `623P` instead of `421P` so that they can't hit you while Allen keeps posing.

A good sample block string would be `2LK` > `2MK` > `236P`. If this hits, cancel into 236236P OR 236236K into [Triple Break Loop](#triple-break-loops).

### Recommended Decks

!!! tip "Infinity"
    - Solid and easy to activate Blue Gougi and extremely powerful Yellow Gougi makes this deck a no-brainer pick.
    - Allen really wants meter for his damage, which Infinity provides almost immediately with its 3 Meter Ups
    - Guard Cancel is generally solid anyway, but Allen has both a strong combo starter with Justice Fist and a reversal with Rising Dragon to punish people's blockstrings and pressure
    - Rage is a very nice bonus, allowing Allen to consistently get full 
    [Triple Break Loop](#triple-break-loops)s in the later rounds.

!!! tip "Aggro" 

    - Very solid Blue Gougi and 2 fairly easy to Trigger Yellow Gougi means this Deck cashes out very quickly. 
    - Chip Up is a difficult Blue Gougi to Trigger quickly, but has a solid effect. It will increase the chip of Soul Force by 50% and increase Fire Force's chip by 100%. 
    - Grab Up is very handy as Allen relies more than usual on his normal throw to open opponents up. 
    - Erase Blow is not immediately useful as he can already deal with projectiles normally, but is good against Doctrine Dark's EX-Plosive. 
    - Illusion is a very handy automatic escape from highly damaging combos, which mitigates dropping combos or being overzealous with Rising Dragon. 
    - Rampage is a big buff to Allen's damage, and Allen can play aggressively and use Soul Force to keep the Rampage stacks topped up.

!!! tip "Nightmare" 

    - Has the easiest Blue Gougi in the game to Trigger with 2 solid Yellow Gougi, Soul Drain unfortunately being very difficult to Trigger. 
    - Speed Up makes Allen's approach even better - Ghost is both easy to Trigger with Allen's fireball game and extended combos (such as his [Triple Break Loop](#triple-break-loops)) and exceptionally powerful, allowing Allen to approach and mix up the opponent while being completely invisible 
    - Energy Drain is a very solid Yellow Gougi, getting Allen his meter. Also very easy to Trigger given that Allen's 2HK is safe and special cancellable, allowing him to easily end meterless combos in a knockdown. 
    - Soul Drain is very much a Round 5 Gougi but does have a powerful Effect that stacks with his Energy Drain.

## Move Analysis

### Notation

This guide uses Numpad notation. That means that directions correspond to the numbers on your keyboard numpad (ie. 6 is right, 4 is left, 8 s up, 2 is down). 5 means no direction held. For example, the classic Hadoken quartercircle motion would look like 236, the classic Tatsumaki/Hurricane Kick motion is 214 and the classic Shoryuken motion is 623.

For the special and super moves listed later on, the first input is the classic input, the second is the progressive input.

Cancel means you can do something else as soon as your first move hits IE. `2MK` on hit can go straight into a special move if you input the special move as `2MK` would hit. Special Cancel means you can cancel into Special Moves and Super Cancel means you can cancel into Super Moves.

Link means you have to let the move finish first before you can do another move. An example is `2MP` into `2MK` where 2MP has to completely start up, hit and recover before the 2MK can come out.

Lows are moves that have to be blocked crouching. Most crouching kicks hit low.

Mids are moves that can blocked either crouching or standing. Almost all standing moves, special moves, supers and crouching punches hit mid.

Highs/overheads are moves that must be blocked standing. Most jumping attacks and all Hard Attacks (`MP + MK`) hit high/overhead.

FEXL runs at 60 frames per second, so 1 frame is a 60th of a second. 2 frames would be 1/30th etc.

Startup means how long it takes for the move to actually hit.

Active means how long the move will actually hit for before recovering. The more active frames the better as a rule.

S.blo stands for standing block. In this case, it shows the difference in time between you recovering from your attack and the opponent recovering from blocking your attack. If it's 0, you both recover and can act at the same time. If it's -1 or lower, the opponent recovers faster and can act before you. If it's 1 or higher, you recover faster and can act before the opponent.

C.blo is similar but when the opponent crouch blocks instead.

The strength of the button determines the length Allen travels.

Has a pretty near "clean hit" mechanic, where hitting with the tip of the fist deals more damage (29 damage to 34), builds slightly more meter and  sets the opponent aflame (cosmetic only, no actual effect.)

While it does destroy fireballs, it should only be used in combos since it's way too dangerous to  miss. Fantastic combo filler, don't use it to end combos if you can help it, especially in the corner.</td>

It's not difficult to learn practical combos that can lead to using all 3 bars of super on Triple Break. The speed and hitbox of Triple Break also allows for some cheeky conversions, making Allen incredibly explosive.

A sample beginner combo may be <code>2LK 2MK 6MK Triple Break > Justice Fist > Triple Break > Justice Fist > Triple Break > Rising Dragon</code>.

## Gameplan

### Neutral

Allen has a selection of decent pokes, with his `5LK`, `5MK`, `2MP` and `2MK` being the most useful. These buttons also can easily combo into `2HK` or even `6MK` into Triple Break or Fire Force, allowing him to cash out damage from his far reaching normals. `2HK` by itself is great for its knockdown but is very bad to whiff given its long recovery.

Allen also has a very solid fireball game allowing him to chip the opponent out and zone them. If they attempt to get around it with jumping, his Rising Dragon and `5HK` allow him to knock the opponent out of the sky. His LP soul force in particular allows him to both control space and even let him run in very safely.

Allen's fast walk speed and run speed allows him to quickly get ground on the opponent and lets him get his pokes into range.

### Offense

#### Mix-Ups

Allen doesn't have overhead normals or specials apart from `MP+MK`, so Allen relies on [Frame Traps](#frame-traps) and [Tick Throws](#tickthrows) along with his command grab (especially a  to open a turtling opponent. His solid crossup kick also lets him get some left-right mixup on opponents recovering from a knockdown. Allen's solid chip options also means that it is no big loss for his strings to be blocked.

#### Set-Ups

!!! quote "Vaulting Kick into Fire Force"

    Simple chip option from fullscreen, sadly you don't get time for much of a runup before the opponent recovers.

### Frame-Traps

!!! quote "Any Delayed Chain"

    As there is always a big window for you to chain one move to a higher strength, essentially any button can become a frame trap by simply delaying the next button just enough to allow a gap for an opponent to press a button that'll then get hit by your delayed button before their move can start up.

    The easiest way of practicing this by setting the training dummy to "After First Hit" and Guard All (Standing) or Guard All (Crouching), and setting either `5LP` or `2LP` in a slot for "Recording Settings (After Guard).

    The dummy will try to jab their way out of any gaps and if you've delayed correctly, you'll hit the dummy out of the startup of their jab. `2MP` or `2MK` are great normals to try and frame trap from.

!!! quote "2MK/2MP > Soul Force"

    Both these normals unchained have a gap that can be beaten out by 5f startup moves, Soul Foce will catch these normals and as it super cancels can start [Triple Break Loop](#triple-break-loops)s. `5HP` works as well, sadly `5HP` still whiffs on some characters if they keep blocking while crouched, including Allen himself (Maybe a full list? Definitely works on D. Dark.) Justice Fist actually works if you feel like being a man and/or being at least -79 if you guess wrong.

!!! quote "5LK/2LK > 2HP"

    A good route to catch people trying to throw through your strings and requires no manual timing. The only downside is that `2HP` is -5 on standing block which is potentially punishable by `2LK` from most characters which makes it weaker for dash-ins. However, `2LK` > `2MK` is a safe route that'll also catch someone attempting to stand block after a `2LK` and there's always the threat of a delayed Fire Force to catch a potential `2LK` punish. It's also possible to tech a throw in the case they attempt that as their punish.

!!! quote "Dash-in 2LK > 5HK"

`5HK` is an alternate ender for the previous route as it's -3 on standing block and if done point blank won't whiff on crouchers. This can still be punished with a throw but Allen can still tech the throw.


### Defense

Allen's defensive play is decent. While not to the level of D.Dark, he can control the stage well with use of his Soul Forces and his 5HKs and Rising Dragons to catch people jumping over the Soul Forces. Unlike D.Dark he can't get combos from stray hits across the screen, so his damage output massively drops. If he has a life lead however and time is running out, he's still pretty good at keeping the opponent out and punishing them for poor approaches and/or winning through a timeout.

#### Reversals

Allen unlike most characters has access to a meterless reversal in his `Rising Dragon`. Unfortunately, he lacks a super cancel that'll keep him safe if the `Rising Dragon` is blocked. Ultimately this comes down to knowledge and knowing when it isn't working out for you.

Allen takes a lot of decks with Guard Cancel and Guard Cancel allows him to Justice Fist his way out of pressure, making for an excellent combo starter. Rising Dragon can also work well as a guard cancel special since the invulnerability should let him get out of most followups to a string.

#### Escapes

Allen doesn't really have any special moves or supers that get him out of trouble. For the most part he needs to run away the old fashioned way or use his Reversals.

## Character Specific Techniques

## Combos

As per all characters, Allen can chain from a normal to a higher strength normal, either punch or kick. Chains work off cancels, meaning that the button doesn't have to finish its animation and can go immediately to the next normal. When links are mentioned, that means the normal HAS to finish and then you can get the next normal to come out. These tend to be harder. His `6MK` chains from every other normal.

### Bread And Butter Combos

(Note: Almost all of these strings will work from a `j.MK` jumpin starter too.)

#### Universal Strings

!!! quote "2/5LK > 2/5MK > 2HK"

    A nice, safe and fairly rewarding chain as it scores you a knockdown and works off your standing or crouching kicks.

!!! quote "2/5LK > 2/5MK > (5HK) > 6MK > ([Triple Break Loop](#triple-break-loops)/ Fire Force)"

    A slightly more risky string as `6MK` is poor on block. If the opponent is definitely standing, feel free to put the `5HK` in for the extra damage.

    If the `6MK` connects, rev up your [Triple Break Loop](#triple-break-loops).

!!! quote "Whatever > Triple Break > Justice Fist > Triple Break > Justice Fist > Triple Break > Rising Dragon"

    A nice and beginner friendly loop. While the individual parts are dangerous to drop, it is fairly easy to pull off regardless.

    It's extremely important to not end the combo with Justice Fist if it won't end the round, especially in the corner (and you will be in the corner, as this combo has fantastic corner carry.)

#### Dash-In combos

!!! quote "2MP > 2MP > 2MK > Soul Force/6MK > ([Triple Break Loop](#triple-break-loops)/ Fire Force)"

    The momentum from your dash allows you to link (Not chain, so timing is a lot more strict) a second `2MP` which can then link into `2MK`.

    This is definitely more difficular than your chains and on blocks there's fairly noticeable gaps that the opponent can jab through. Mix it up with cancelling your `2MP`s into Soul Force to frame trap them.

    A very respectable punish combo against very unsafe moves like Rising Dragons or many blocked supers.

### Hit-Confirms

!!! quote "2LK> 2MK > 6MK > Whatever"

    If `6MK` will be blocked, it's better to go into Soul Force or `2HK` instead.

!!! quote "Whatever > Soul Force"

    Soul Force is both a decent blockstring ender and can go into both Fire Force or Triple Break, making it a no-brainer to cancel into from a chain of normals for the most part.
    Soul Force becomes way more unsafe in the corner however and so you'll prefer to end corner strings in `2HK`.

### Anti-Air Conversions

!!! quote "5HK > Triple Break"

    This allows Allen to potentially deal 50%+ off antiairs using a [Triple Break Loop](#triple-break-loops). Annoyingly, this can easily drop off max range 5HK connects, making it pretty risky to confirm.

!!! quote "5HK > Fire Force"

    A less rewarding but much less unsafe super cancel. Depending on how you hit it, may just deal 1 hit or get the full 5 hits. If you have the spare meter, this is a pretty safe way of squeezing out extra damage.
    
    Make sure you delay it though, as the opponent can still sail over the Fire Force and punish it depending on how the `5HK` hits.

!!! quote "Rising Dragon > Triple Break"

    This is very much on the ballsy side, but allows you to use Rising Dragon to get past jump-ins that beat your `5HK` (And there's quite a few, such as Darun's j.HK, Shadowgeist's Shadow Sword Kick and Pullum Purna's Drill Purrus) and get your [Triple Break Loop](#triple-break-loops).

### Air to Air Conversions

!!! quote "j.MK/HK > Triple Break"

    Depending on both your height and the opponent's height, you can fairly often get Triple Break to catch them as they fall.
    As a rule, if you hit them as you're on your way up your jump, you'll probably not land in time for the Triple Break.

!!! quote "j.MK/HK > 5HK > (Triple Break)"

    `5HK` will fairly often catch the opponent similarly to Triple Break but way less dangerous if it misses. 

!!! quote "j.MK/HK > Justice Fist > Triple Break"

    Despite how dangerous the Justice Fist is to whiff, it actually works fairly reliably. The HP version of Justice Fist can often go under people and whiff, definitely practice this in training on a jumping opponent to get a feel for it. If you can land this, you can do 50% damage very easily off a basic full [Triple Break Loop](#triple-break-loops)

### Triple Break Loops

This is THE Allen Snider combo. Easily converts from any move that super cancels and repeated as long as you have the meter. Also gives you an opportunity to figure out what Allen is actually shouting (Four Two Kick? Fortune Break?). You can potentially squeeze more damage out by getting clean hits of Justice Fist, but really, it's best to make sure the combo is finished.

!!! quote "Whatever > Triple Break > Justice Fist > Triple Break > Justice Fist > Triple Break > Rising Dragon"
    
    As mentioned early, this is the basic Triple Break loop. Will work anywhere on the screen and deal roughly 40% damage.

!!! quote "Whatever > Triple Break > 2MP > 5MK > Justice Fist > Triple Break > Justice Fist > Triple Break > Rising Dragon"
    
    A slightly more optimal loop, corner only as 5MK will fall out midscreen. Sneaks in a bit more damage and also builds you more meter. Another corner variant is to do `5MP > 5HP > Justice Fist`.

    Any of these extensions only work after the first Triple Break, just stick to Justice Fist after the 2nd or third Triple Breaks.

!!! quote "Whatever > Triple Break > 5LK > 5MK > 5HK > (in corner 6MK) > Triple Break > 5LK > 5MK > 5HK > (in corner 6MK) > Triple Break > Rising Dragon"

    Another potential loop, the trick is to get the 5LK to hit late during the first loop but then do it quicker the second time. Builds a lot of meter, often allowing you to sneak in one more Triple Break than usual.

## Glossary

### Kara Cancel

Kara Cancelling (Or "Empty" cancelling) is a fairly old fighting game glitch that lets you start up a move and then almost immediately input a more "difficult" action/move. The input system thinks you've done the simpler move by accident and lets you go straight into your more complicated move. In Allen's case, by Kara Cancelling `2HK` and doing Vaulting Kick, you get the movement from the start of 2HK and then grab, teleporting Allen forward surprisingly far. You don't necessarily need to do anything tricky, just do it quickly and you'll see Allen suddenly scoot forward and maybe catch a few frames of the 2HK startup. A input that might work better would be 63K > 214K.

### Tick Throw

Tick Throws are generally when you drop strings, often only doing jabs and attempted a delayed grab (do it instantly and the opponent will probably still have throw immunity from blockstun, causing the grab to whiff), catching a blocking opponent who is expecting a string to start or continue. 

Sadly, Allen doesn't get to enjoy being + after his jabs, but this is still a very effective way of sneaking in grabs while starting from a string, and it causes the opponent to second-guess blocking strings.

<h2 id="brief-overview">Brief Overview</h2>
<h3 id="type-of-character">Type of Character</h3>
<p>Doctrine Dark is a fairly unorthodox character that both plays lame and zone-y, but also can pull off powerful mixups and setups up close. A combination of wires and mines allow him to constrict the opponent's movement options very easily and also let him get full combos off any confirm. While he suffers from poor damage and some bad normals, Doctrine Dark dictates the pace of each match and frustrates the other player into making bad decisions which he can fully capitalize on.</p>
<div class="admonition success">
<p class="admonition-title">Strengths</p>
<ul>
<li>Strong defensive play with his Dark Wire, Dark Defender and EX-Plosive, shutting down many approachs from both air and ground. </li>
<li>Dark Wire can be both combo'd out of and into, making it a great combo starter and combo linker. </li>
<li>A decent suite of anti-air Normals and Specials and can often goad the enemy into jumping.</li>
<li>With the right gougi, can easily play both very defensively and very offensively, switching as needed. </li>
<li>Fantastic setups if D.Dark gets the knockdown, even allowing him to get unblockables with the right setup and Gougi.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="admonition failure">
<p class="admonition-title">Weaknesses</p>
<ul>
<li>Has quite a few stubby normals, making his strings fairly awkward and limited</li>
<li>Very low damage even with meter, making him a poor comeback character </li>
<li>Doesn't have particularly good ways of spending all his meter in a combo. </li>
<li>No meterless reversals, and his metered reversals aren't great either. </li>
<li>Fairly technical and doesn't have as many easy rewarding combo routes as other characters</li>
</ul>
</div>
<h3 id="5-minute-guide">5 Minute Guide</h3>
<p>(if you don't know what the abbreviations mean, check the <a href="#notation">notation</a> guide below.)</p>
<p>Take Shinobi as your deck, D.Dark can easily lame out the opponent for 12 seconds at the start of the match to get Ghost Triggered, letting you turn invisible when you dash. You also get Guard Cancel, which lets you do Specials and Supers out of blockstun. </p>
<p><code>2MP</code>, <code>2LK</code>, <code>2MK</code> and <code>5LK</code> are decent pokes.</p>
<p>Keep the opponent out the opponent with <code>EX-Plosive</code> and <code>Dark Wire</code> (236P). This'll often force them to jump. If they land or walk into <code>EX-Plosive</code>, it's often a free combo and even from faraway you can catch them with <code>Dark Wire</code>. You still want to be close enough that you can easily dash in to start your offense and also have <code>EX-plosive</code> threaten the opponent.</p>
<p>If someone is jumping in on you, either do <code>5HK</code> or <code>2HP</code>. Super Cancel into <code>Dark Knife</code> (236236P) if you get the hit. D.Dark can instead use <code>Dark Defender</code> (623P) and juggle into <code>5HK</code>/<code>2HP</code> &gt; <code>Dark Knife</code>.</p>
<p>For jump-ins, stick to <code>j.MK</code>. This is also your crossup jump-in normal.</p>
<p>D.Dark has some particularly awkward normals, so for chains stick to <code>2LK</code> &gt; <code>2MK</code> &gt; <code>2HK</code>. The <code>2HK</code> is almost completely safe so feel free to end blockstrings with it.</p>
<p>If your chain hits, instead of <code>2HK</code>, you can either do <code>6MK</code> &gt; <code>Dark Shackle</code> (236236K) or go from the <code>2MK</code> into <code>Dark Wire</code> (236P).</p>
<p>When you hit with <code>Dark Wire</code>, pull them in by doing <code>Dark Hold</code> (4P). If you want to activate G.Break by doing <code>Hard Attack</code> (MP + MK), you can easily do <code>Hard Attack</code> &gt; <code>Dark Knife</code>. Otherwise, quickly dash forward (66) and immediately do <code>5LK</code> &gt; <code>5MK</code> &gt; <code>5HK</code> &gt; <code>Dark Knife</code>.</p>
<p>If the opponent is knocked down, put a <code>EX-Plosive</code> on top or in front of them as they get up. Mix it up with his <code>2LK</code>/<code>2MK</code>, normal throws, <code>Hard Attack</code> and cross-up <code>j.MK</code> along with any gougi-specific mixups such as Hunting or Guard Break.</p>
<h3 id="recommended-decks">Recommended Decks</h3>
<div class="admonition tip">
<p class="admonition-title">Shinobi</p>
<ul>
<li>Very solid Blue Gougi granting him an 5% damage increase and 10% speed increase almost immediately into the match.</li>
<li>Guard Break is a perfect fit for D.Dark as not only does he get truly unblockable setups from it, but also is able to combo into Hard Attacks through Dark Wire very easily, making him far and away the best character to Trigger the Gougi.</li>
<li>Ghost massively improves D.Dark's offense. It's also very easy to Trigger as D.Dark has the tools to zone out the opponent for 12 seconds right out of the gate.</li>
<li>Guard Cancel as always is a fantastic defensive Gougi. This helps out D.Dark's poor defense.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="admonition tip">
<p class="admonition-title">Stealth Raptor</p>
<ul>
<li>Very solid selection of Blue Gougi, the 2 Speed Ups boosts D.Dark's mobility by 20% while the Grab Up gives him a handy range increase, making his shimmying even stronger.</li>
<li>Utsusemi helps with D.Dark's poor defense and lack of real escapes. Not on the level of Guard Cancel, but a decent defensive buff regardless.</li>
<li>Hunting gives D.Dark a strong short hop, massively improving his mixup.</li>
</ul>

<p>For the special and super moves listed later on, the first input is the classic input, the second is the progressive input.</p>
<p>Cancel means you can do something else as soon as your first move hits IE. <code>2MK</code> on hit can go straight into a special move if you input the special move as <code>2MK</code> would hit. Special Cancel means you can cancel into Special Moves and Super Cancel means you can cancel into Super Moves.</p>
<p>Link means you have to let the move finish first before you can do another move. An example is <code>2MP</code> into <code>2MK</code> where 2MP has to completely start up, hit and recover before the 2MK can come out.</p>
<p>Lows are moves that have to be blocked crouching. Most crouching kicks hit low.</p>
<p>Mids are moves that can blocked either crouching or standing. Almost all standing moves, special moves, supers and crouching punches hit mid.</p>
<p>Highs/overheads are moves that must be blocked standing. Most jumping attacks and all Hard Attacks (<code>MP + MK</code>) hit high/overhead.</p>
<p>FEXL runs at 60 frames per second, so 1 frame is a 60<sup>th</sup> of a second. 2 frames would be 1/30<sup>th</sup> etc.</p>
<p>Startup means how long it takes for the move to actually hit.</p>
<p>Active means how long the move will actually hit for before recovering. The more active frames the better as a rule.</p>
<p>S.blo stands for standing block. In this case, it shows the difference in time between you recovering from your attack and the opponent recovering from blocking your attack. If it's 0, you both recover and can act at the same time. If it's -1 or lower, the opponent recovers faster and can act before you. If it's 1 or higher, you recover faster and can act before the opponent.</p>
<p>C.blo is similar but when the opponent crouch blocks instead.</p>

However,  Dark Wire confirms from strings are generally more safe, reliable and can potentially lead to more damage. Specific interactions with Gougi (IE. landing 4 Hard Attacks) also make Dark Wire routes generally the better option.

A few things to note is that it is a fixed distance that the opponent stumbles, so certain combos (particularly combos involving j.HK as a starter) may need to be adjusted to still land. Also, the opponent is in a special state that means they won't be grounded after being hit. This prevents you from just doing yet another regular combo back into Dark Wire, but does still allow decent followups. Check the combo section below to figure out your followups. </td>

If it hits an airborne opponent raw, it'll send them into a slow descending spiral. Otherwise, it'll knock them up slightly instead and cannot be followed up on except with a Super Cancel into `Dark Knife`. As a result, it's not a combo extension tool like `Dark Wire` but is an excellent anti-air combo starter.

The strength of the kick determines how long it takes for the bomb to go off. Along with `Dark Wire`, this is D.Dark's main zoning tool, but is also used for many of his setups. Unless the bomb hits the opponent before it even gets to the ground, a hit can easily be followed up on. This is both good for catching people jumping or walking into it in neutral and using it as a meaty on a knocked down opponent. A regular `2LK` > `2MK` > etc. combo will work as normal off a successful bomb hit. Importantly it becomes even better if kara-cancelled from a `2HK`, giving the bomb toss more effective range and moving D.Dark forward.</td>

<h2 id="gameplan">Gameplan</h2>
<h3 id="neutral">Neutral</h3>
<p>D.Dark doesn't have too many pokes given that a lot of his standing normals are very close ranged elbow and knee strikes. Use <code>2LK</code>, <code>2MK</code> and <code>2MP</code> as your general normal pokes. </p>
<p>D.Dark instead shines in neutral through use of his <code>Dark Wire</code> and <code>EX-Plosive</code>. The bombs can easily prevent grounded approaches and forces the opponent to take obvious jump arcs to avoid it, playing into D.Dark's anti-air game. His <code>Dark Wire</code> also destroys fireballs, forcing a stalemate against other fireball character.</p>
<p>Unlike other fireball characters however, D.Dark can't really chip the opponent out from full screen, so he will need to eventually go on the offense. He has decent mobility but no dedicated moves to help him out and a standard jump arc which is why Gougi Decks such as Shinobi and Stealth Raptor help him out so much.</p>
<p>Your general gameplan for most of D.Dark's Decks is to lame out the opponent for long enough to get Ghost at which point you'll mix it up between zoning and approaching the opponent. D.Dark's damage is very poor and he struggles to really dump his meter, so getting health leads and keeping them is key. Don't hesitate to use your offense and setups to get the health lead and then just stick to laming out the opponent. The threat of the short timer will also often coerce the opponent into making risky approaches, and D.Dark's EX-Plosive and the threat of his Dark Wire are perfect for capitalizing on that.</p>
<p>For anti-airing, you'll want to stick to <code>2HP</code> and <code>5HK</code>. <code>Dark Defender</code> can be used but has a fairly awkward angle and is awful to whiff.</p>
<h3 id="offense">Offense</h3>
<p>D.Dark isn't necessarily the best character to rush down an opponent with, but his defensive play often either allows him to approach easily or catch a frustrated enemy attempting to approach. If D.Dark can score a knockdown on the opponent, he can also enforce extremely strong mixups that lead into knockdowns as well. His deck choices are based on buffing his offense as a result.</p>
<h3 id="mix-ups">Mix-Ups</h3>
<p>D.Dark has incredibly solid mix ups and ways to force the mixup on opponents. You have access to the usual arsenal of quick low-hitting attacks, command Overheads (<code>Hard Attack</code> and <code>Knife Nightmare</code> crossups, jumps into jumping normals that hit overhead or otherwise doing a empty jump into a low, frametraps and tick-throws. His <code>EX-plosive</code> placed as a meaty forces the opponent to block as they get up, giving D.Dark free reign to enforce his mixup.</p>
<p>He does have 2 command overheads, but in particular if he takes a deck with Guard Break he gets access to a unblockable that leads to full combos and even gets unblockable setups.</p>
<h3 id="set-ups">Set-Ups</h3>
<div class="admonition quote">
<p class="admonition-title">Hard Knockdown (From a Dark Knife for example) &gt; EX-Plosive &gt; Just block</p>
<p>The most basic okizeme/vortex you can pull off, if an opponent is consistently attempt to mash/reversal out as they get back up, you'll be able to block them and combo them for free either as they come back down or from getting hit by the <code>EX-Plosive</code>. Otherwise, if they block in turn you have enough time to react and then continue your pressure on the blocking opponent</p>
</div>
<div class="admonition quote">
<p class="admonition-title">In the corner, 2HK &gt; Whiff 2LP &gt; 236LK/236MK (EX-Plosive)</p>
<p>A excellent setup which will be a meaty on both a normal getup and a Recover. If it connects, you can combo into <code>2MP</code>/<code>2MK</code>. Otherwise, you'll be +2 on crouching block or -1 on standing block. On a normal getup you'll also have enough time to set the bomb and block any reversals, including Allen's Rising Dragon and Blair Dame's Lightning Knee/Shoot Upper. The EX-Plosive will combo into Hard Attack as well, and if they block the bomb a Guard Break Hard Attack is almost guaranteed to land. (Credit to Labryz.)</p>
</div>
<h3 id="frame-traps">Frame-Traps</h3>
<div class="admonition quote">
<p class="admonition-title">Any Delayed Chain</p>
<p>As there is always a big window for you to chain one move to a higher strength, essentially any button can become a frame trap by simply delaying the next button just enough to allow a gap for an opponent to press a button that'll then get hit by your delayed button before their move can start up.</p>
<p>The easiest way of practicing this by setting the training dummy to "After First Hit" and Guard All (Standing) or Guard All (Crouching), and setting either <code>5LP</code> or <code>2LP</code> in a slot for "Recording Settings (After Guard).</p>
<p>The dummy will try to jab their way out of any gaps and if you've delayed correctly, you'll hit the dummy out of the startup of their jab. <code>2MP</code> or <code>2MK</code> are great normals to try and frame trap from.</p>
</div>
<div class="admonition quote">
<p class="admonition-title">2MK &gt; 4MK</p>
<p>A very nice frametrap for catching people jumping out of your pressure. Requires no manual timing and is a easy combo into <code>Dark Knife</code>. A sample string into this frametrap would be <code>2LK</code> &gt; <code>2MK</code> &gt; <code>4MK</code> &gt; <code>Dark Knife</code> on hit. 4MK unfortunately is fairly unsafe on block but since it's super cancellable you can still catch punish attempts.</p>
</div>
<div class="admonition quote">
<p class="admonition-title">Dash-in 2MP &gt; 2HP</p>
<p>Requires a slightly delay, but is good for catching people attempting to throw you if you keep trying to link 2MP. from a dash-in.</p>
</div>
<h3 id="defense">Defense</h3>
<p>Doctrine Dark's defensive play is strong from the start of the match. A backdash that covers a huge amount of ground allows him to quickly peel himself away from the opponent. It's a decent round opener.</p>
<p>Once you have enough space, laying down a <code>EX-Plosive</code> makes it much more difficult for the opponent to approach. Opponents running into it without blocking or jumping on top of it keeps them grounded and is a free <code>Dark Wire</code> or Dash-in <code>2LK</code> combo. </p>
<p>The opponent can jump over it, but their jump arc will be much more obvious as they'll get to get clear over the bomb. D.Dark has a suite of good anti-airs to deal with this as well. His <code>2HP</code> will catch opponents jumping in on top of him, while <code>2HK</code> catches opponent jumping in from further away. Both of these can cancel into a <code>Dark Knife</code> and score a hard knockdown. <code>Dark Defender</code>, while having a fairly awkward arc, leads to a much stronger follow up (check the <a href="#darkwire/darkdefenderroutes">Dark Wire/Dark Defender Routes</a>). <code>Dark Wire</code> is both long ranged and pretty active so it makes a decent anti-air for jump-ins that neither your normals or <code>Dark Defender</code> could reach.</p>
<p>D.Dark however doesn't completely zone out the opponent from anywhere on the screen. His <code>Dark Wire</code> isn't quite fullscreen and without the threat of a nearby <code>EX-Plosive</code> opponents can move forward safely. Playing fullscreen won't allow you to chip out an opponent or even effectively control space that well, so you want to make sure you're within around 2/3rds camera distance from the opponent as a rule. </p>
<p>This also makes D.Dark a bit dangerous to play as. One wrong move and an opponent can be on top of you very quickly and pump out a lot more damage than D.Dark. He also lacks particularly good reversals or escapes, making him quite susceptible to other characters' vortex/pressure.</p>
<h3 id="reversals">Reversals</h3>
<p>D.Dark unfortunately has no meterless reversals. Dark Knife is probably your best bet due to its quick startup and potential to start your own vortex as it'll hard knockdown the opponent. Shinobi allows him to Guard Cancel, which massively buffs his options while blocking, either going immediately into a <code>Dark Knife</code> or pulling off a <code>Dark Wire</code>.</p>
<h3 id="escapes">Escapes</h3>
<p>D.Dark has a particularly good backdash that travels a long distance. While the usual weaknesses of being grounded for the duration and a lack of non-throw invuln still apply, D.Dark can be pretty slippery. Utsusemi (part of the Stealth Raptor deck) also heavily buffs his Recovery and makes potential backdashes and jump outs much less obvious.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="character-specific-techniques">Character Specific Techniques</h2>
<h2 id="combos">Combos</h2>
<p>All characters can chain from a normal to a higher strength normal, either punch or kick. Chains work off cancels, meaning that the button doesn't have to finish its animation and can go immediately to the next normal. When links are mentioned, that means the normal HAS to finish and then you can get the next normal to come out. These tend to be harder. Unique/command normals chain from any normal.</p>

</div>
<p>Becomes even better in the corner where even if the opponent Recovers, they still have to hold your mixup.</p>
<div class="admonition quote">
<p class="admonition-title">2/5LK &gt; 2/5MK &gt; (2HP) &gt; 4MK &gt; Dark Shackle</p>
<p>The 2HP can be added if you're dashing in, otherwise it'll likely drop. A decent combo if you're catching the opponent grounded but generally getting into a Dark Wire Combo is preferred.</p>
</div>
<h4 id="dark-wiredark-defender-routes">Dark Wire/Dark Defender Routes</h4>
<div class="admonition quote">
<p class="admonition-title">2/5LK &gt; 2/5MK &gt; Dark Wire &gt; Dash-in 5MP &gt; 5HK &gt; Dark Knife</p>
</div>
<p>The main bread and butter combo for D.Dark. You have to dash in with the 5MP as otherwise when you cancel into <code>Dark Knife</code>, the opponent will be too far away.</p>
<div class="admonition quote">
<p class="admonition-title">j.HP/j.HK, dash-in 5MP &gt; 5HK &gt; (In Corner, 4MK) &gt; Dark Knife</p>
</div>
<p>Similar to the combo before but is a bit more finicky and spacing dependent. You'll want to be closer to your opponent, but too close and you'll either jump too far back or otherwise jump over the opponent. If the opponent is more than a half screen away, you'll mostly likely need to jump straight up instead of back.</p>
<div class="admonition quote">
<p class="admonition-title">Dark Hold &gt; EX-Prominence</p>
<p>A potential route to take if you land a full screen Dark Wire. The opponent gets to stumble into EX-Prominence and is one of the few times you'll get to combo into it.</p>
</div>
<div class="admonition quote">
<p class="admonition-title">2/5LK &gt; 2/5MK &gt; Dark Wire &gt; Hard Attack &gt; Dark Knife</p>
</div>
<p>Another route, this one is mainly useful for activating  Guard Break as the Hard Attack is guaranteed to combo.</p>
<div class="admonition quote">
<p class="admonition-title">(In the corner) dash-in 5MP &gt; 5HK &gt; 4MK &gt; Dark Knife</p>
</div>
<p>A corner only variant which does good damage and is a lot less awkward than pulling off a j.HK close to the corner.</p>
<h4 id="dash-in-combos">Dash-In combos</h4>
<div class="admonition quote">
<p class="admonition-title">2MP &gt; 2MP &gt; 2MK &gt; Dark Wire Route</p>
<p>The momentum from your dash allows you to link (Not chain, so timing is a lot more strict) a second <code>2MP</code> which can then link into <code>2MK</code>. This is definitely more difficult than your chains and on blocks there's fairly noticeable gaps that the opponent can jab through. Mix it up with cancelling your <code>2MP</code>s into a slightly delayed <code>2HP</code>.</p>
</div>
<h3 id="hit-confirms">Hit-Confirms</h3>
<p>D.Dark's normal combo routes unfortunately end with unsafe specials or supers. For the most part, ending your combo routes in 2HK is the way to go.</p>
<h3 id="anti-air-conversions">Anti-Air Conversions</h3>
<div class="admonition quote">
<p class="admonition-title">5HK/2HP &gt; Dark Knife</p>
<p>A easy and consistent route that leads to a hard knockdown.</p>
</div>
<div class="admonition quote">
<p class="admonition-title">Dark Defender &gt; EX-Plosive &gt; Dash-in 5MP &gt; 5HK &gt; Dark Knife</p>
<p>A easy enough conversion to make from Dark Defender which leads to a hard knockdown.</p>
</div>
<h3 id="air-to-air-conversions">Air to Air Conversions</h3>
<div class="admonition quote">
<p class="admonition-title">Air-To-Air Normal &gt; (5HK) &gt; Dark Knife</p>
<p>As D.Dark has no air supers, he relies on this height dependent route, and it's entirely possible that the opponent will land before you do. Your safest bet is to try and combo into <code>5HK</code> and THEN go into <code>Dark Knife</code>.</p>
</div>
<h3 id="spending-more-than-1-bar">Spending More than 1 bar</h3>
<div class="admonition quote">
<p class="admonition-title">Dark Shackle &gt; Dark Knife &gt; Dark Shackle</p>
<p>D.Dark isn't particularly good at dumping all his meter into a combo. From a grounded hit, this is the best 3 super route to make. You'll want to cancel into the second <code>Dark Shackle</code> before the <code>Dark Knife</code> can launch the opponent so you can hit <code>Dark Shackle</code> grounded and get the second part of the super. If the opponent is airborne, you can invert the combo (<code>Dark Knife</code> &gt; <code>Dark Shackle</code> &gt; <code>Dark Knife</code>) but this is even less damage.</p>
</div>
<div class="admonition quote">
<p class="admonition-title">Dark Knife &gt; EX-Prominence</p>
<p>Another grounded route, this time from Dark Knife which will most likely be from when you use it as a reversal. On the fourth hit, as D.Dark is about to make his second uppercut lunge, cancel into the EX-Prominence.</p>

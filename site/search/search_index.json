His solid fireball and Dragon Punch (well, Rising Dragon) and generally good normals are supplemented with relatively easy and damaging loops using his Triple Break super to launch the opponent over and over as long as he has the meter. His command grab and Justice Fist, a super cancellable and high damaging move that's otherwise negative on hit(!) rounds him out and in general is a incredibly solid and accessible character. Strengths His projectile (Soul Force, 236P ) and dragon punch (Rising Dragon, 623P ) allows for solid \"Super Turbo\" style play by zoning out the opponent with fireballs and catching their jumps with Rising Dragon or his 5HK Decent chip options with both Soul Force and Fire Force without having to use Gougi such as Berserker Can consistently turn confirms into high damage with Triple Break Loop s, allowing him to easily cash out damage from his meter Has both a dragon punch (Rising Dragon) and his 5HK for anti airing Decent normals in general Has a great meterless reversal with Rising Dragon His fireball game allows him to generate meter in the neutral very well. Weaknesses Somewhat low damage without meter No real 100% guaranteed anti-air / air-to-air conversions, attempting to cash in more damage is a risk Many of his damaging options are unsafe and often fully punishable if they don't hit or are blocked Reversal options are all unsafe or punishable, making them incredibly risky. 5 Minute Guide (if you don't know what the abbreviations mean, check the notation guide below.) Take Infinity as your deck, lets you gain 130% meter almost immediately, after doing 10 supers you get a rapidly regenerating super bar 2LK , 2MP , 2MK , 5LK , 5MK are all good buttons to poke with. 236P is a nice fireball. If someone is jumping in on you, either do 5HK or 623P . You can do 623P as you're getting up if someone is trying to hit you, you'll get combo'd for free if it's blocked. For combos, start off with light kicks or punches, move up to medium kicks or punches and then to hard kicks or punches. Easiest and most reliable one is 2LK > 2MK > 2HK . If your combo lands, as long as you haven't done 2HK yet you can do 6MK and then immediately do 236236P to get a fireball super. This'll deal about 20% of their health in damage. If you do 236236K instead of 236236P in combos, you can catch the opponent on the way down with 421P and immediately do 236236K again. You can do this over and over as long as you have the meter. When you've done your last 236236K do 623P instead of 421P so that they can't hit you while Allen keeps posing. A good sample block string would be 2LK > 2MK > 236P . If this hits, cancel into 236236P OR 236236K into Triple Break Loop . Recommended Decks Infinity Solid and easy to activate Blue Gougi and extremely powerful Yellow Gougi makes this deck a no-brainer pick. Allen really wants meter for his damage, which Infinity provides almost immediately with its 3 Meter Ups Guard Cancel is generally solid anyway, but Allen has both a strong combo starter with Justice Fist and a reversal with Rising Dragon to punish people's blockstrings and pressure Rage is a very nice bonus, allowing Allen to consistently get full Triple Break Loop s in the later rounds. Aggro Very solid Blue Gougi and 2 fairly easy to Trigger Yellow Gougi means this Deck cashes out very quickly. Chip Up is a difficult Blue Gougi to Trigger quickly, but has a solid effect. It will increase the chip of Soul Force by 50% and increase Fire Force's chip by 100%. Grab Up is very handy as Allen relies more than usual on his normal throw to open opponents up. Erase Blow is not immediately useful as he can already deal with projectiles normally, but is good against Doctrine Dark's EX-Plosive. Illusion is a very handy automatic escape from highly damaging combos, which mitigates dropping combos or being overzealous with Rising Dragon. Rampage is a big buff to Allen's damage, and Allen can play aggressively and use Soul Force to keep the Rampage stacks topped up. Nightmare Has the easiest Blue Gougi in the game to Trigger with 2 solid Yellow Gougi, Soul Drain unfortunately being very difficult to Trigger. Speed Up makes Allen's approach even better - Ghost is both easy to Trigger with Allen's fireball game and extended combos (such as his Triple Break Loop ) and exceptionally powerful, allowing Allen to approach and mix up the opponent while being completely invisible Energy Drain is a very solid Yellow Gougi, getting Allen his meter. Also very easy to Trigger given that Allen's 2HK is safe and special cancellable, allowing him to easily end meterless combos in a knockdown. Soul Drain is very much a Round 5 Gougi but does have a powerful Effect that stacks with his Energy Drain. Move Analysis Notation This guide uses Numpad notation. That means that directions correspond to the numbers on your keyboard numpad (ie. 6 is right, 4 is left, 8 s up, 2 is down). 5 means no direction held. For example, the classic Hadoken quartercircle motion would look like 236, the classic Tatsumaki/Hurricane Kick motion is 214 and the classic Shoryuken motion is 623. Notation Meaning LP Light Punch MP Medium Punch HP Heavy Punch LK Light Kick MK Medium Kick HK Heavy Kick MP+MK Press both MP and MK at the same time. For the special and super moves listed later on, the first input is the classic input, the second is the progressive input. Cancel means you can do something else as soon as your first move hits IE. 2MK on hit can go straight into a special move if you input the special move as 2MK would hit. Special Cancel means you can cancel into Special Moves and Super Cancel means you can cancel into Super Moves. Link means you have to let the move finish first before you can do another move. An example is 2MP into 2MK where 2MP has to completely start up, hit and recover before the 2MK can come out. Lows are moves that have to be blocked crouching. Most crouching kicks hit low. Mids are moves that can blocked either crouching or standing. Almost all standing moves, special moves, supers and crouching punches hit mid. Highs/overheads are moves that must be blocked standing. Most jumping attacks and all Hard Attacks ( MP + MK ) hit high/overhead. FEXL runs at 60 frames per second, so 1 frame is a 60 th of a second. 2 frames would be 1/30 th etc. Startup means how long it takes for the move to actually hit. Active means how long the move will actually hit for before recovering. The more active frames the better as a rule. S.blo stands for standing block. In this case, it shows the difference in time between you recovering from your attack and the opponent recovering from blocking your attack. If it's 0, you both recover and can act at the same time. If it's -1 or lower, the opponent recovers faster and can act before you. If it's 1 or higher, you recover faster and can act before the opponent. C.blo is similar but when the opponent crouch blocks instead. Normal Moves Normal Description Startup Active S.blo C.blo 5LP Allen's fastest normal with somewhat decent range, whiffs on crouchers Special Cancels. 4 2 -5 -1 5MP A fairly mediocre mid, 2MP is preferred. Allen's only standing punch that doesn't whiff on crouchers. Is a decent meaty given its active frames. Special Cancels. 6 6 -5 -1 5HP A stubby mid that whiffs on crouchers from further away, not worth using in neutral. Special Cancels. Stick to 5HK for anti-airing. Super Cancels. 13 3 -2 0 5LK Nice and quick long reaching normal, sadly doesn't hit low despite its animation. Special Cancels. 5 6 -8 -4 5MK Another long range normal, thankfully doesn't whiff on crouchers, making it decent for blockstrings. Special Cancels. 7 6 -12 -8 5HK Allen's dedicated anti-air button. This one works better for catching people jumping in far away, as its angle is pretty poor for people jumping right on top of you (Use Rising Dragon instead for that). Super cancellable, so is a decent way of starting Triple Break Loops . Whiffs on crouchers. 8 8 -3 -1 2LP Good jab with long range that's only 1 frame slower than 5LP, decent for tick throws. Special Cancels. 5 5 -4 -0 2MP Solid mid hitting normal, links into itself with dashing momentum and into 2MK as well. Special Cancels. 6 6 -4 0 2HP An okay mid hitting punch, 2HK's long range makes it better for blockstrings. Sees more use for Allen's frame traps. Super Cancels 8 6 -5 -2 2LK Very fast long ranged kick that hits low, solid button in general. Special Cancels. 5 6 Hits Low -2 2MK Like 2LK but slightly longer, another solid button and can be used like any Street Fighter shoto's 2MK to catch opponents dashing in. Special Cancels. 6 5 Hits Low -3 2HK Allen's sweep, excellent range, low profile and fantastic frame data makes it great for ending block strings and dodging high attacks/fireballs. Special and Super Cancels, but as it knocks down on hit it can't be used to continue combos. 7 ? Hits Low -2 j.LP Downward reaching jab, not particularly useful. 4 ? ? Hits Overhead j.MP Similar to j.LP but slower, just use j.HP for the same normal but better. 5 ? 13 Hits Overhead j.HP Probably the best jumping punch he has. However, his kick aerials are stronger in any case. 5 ? 13 Hits Overhead j.LK A downward kick, just use j.MK instead. 5 ? 5 Hits Overhead j.MK Allen's best general aerial, faster than j.LK for some reason and can also cross up on opponents. Stick to this one for your jump ins. 4 ? 13 Hits Overhead j.HK Decent air to air and deals a solid chunk of damage, use this when your opponent is a bit too jump happy. 8 ? 13 Hits Overhead Command Normals Command Normal Description Startup S.blo C.blo 6MK Can be chained into from any normal, Super Cancelable only. The slow startup and poor frame advantage means this should only be used in strings that have already hit. Will actually get over most `2LKs` and `2MKs`. Still, it's a great way of getting into Triple Break from a confirmed string. Has a good niche against D.Dark's EX-Prominence as it'll easily move past its hitbox. 17 -12 -8 MP+MK (Hard Attack) Allen's universal overhead, should mainly be used to catch people trying to block Allen's many good lows and should be always be super cancelled as it is actually - on hit! Still, fairly decent to throw out once in a while. While Allen jumps, its speed and actual hurtbox makes it pretty poor for getting over low normals. 32 -34 -4 Specials Special Move Description Startup S.blo C.blo Soul Force (236P/6P) A regular fireball that travels the length of the screen, the strength of the punch controls the speed of the fireball. Super cancels which allows for confirms into Fire Force or even start a Triple Break Loops . Generally safe at long ranges but be wary of using it in blockstrings, as upclose it is outright punishable on block. Soul Force has decent pushback midscreen but will not pushback in the corner. 13/-14/-11 13/-14/-11 13/-14/-11 Rising Dragon (623P/3P) A rising uppercut that is invulnerable on startup, making it an excellent anti-air and reversal. Massively unsafe on block however with each strength getting progressively worse. The strength of the button determines the height and number of hits of Rising Dragon. Super cancels, Fire force making it less unsafe and Triple Break potentially starting a loop on hit but will be just as unsafe on block. 5/-18/-16 5/-31/-29 5/-35/-33 Justice Fist (421P/4P) An advanced outstretching lunge which deals great damage but is unsafe on hit, never mind on block. Very importantly, it super cancels which makes it excellent as combo filler for Triple Break Loops . The strength of the button determines the length Allen travels. Has a pretty near \"clean hit\" mechanic, where hitting with the tip of the fist deals more damage (29 damage to 34), builds slightly more meter and sets the opponent aflame (cosmetic only, no actual effect.) While it does destroy fireballs, it should only be used in combos since it's way too dangerous to miss. Fantastic combo filler, don't use it to end combos if you can help it, especially in the corner. 15/-79/-75 15/-83/-79 15/-87/-83 Vaulting Kick (63214K/8K) An command grab that knocks the opponent to the opposite side of the screen. No difference in button versions. Does slightly more damage than normal grab, but is mainly useful for being untechable. Notably can be Kara Cancelled to increase the range of the command grab. 3 Grab Grab Supers Quick note, in startup framedata (eg. x + y), x means the startup until Super Freeze and Y is the startup for the super to come out afterwards. Super Description Startup S.blo C.blo Fire Force (236236P/46P) A super version of Soul Force with 5 hits., deals somewhat low damage but is a much safer cancel than Triple Break and can even cancel into Triple Break. Decent chip option as well. Fairly fast, can potentially be used to beat out other projectiles in a fireball war. Similarly to Soul Force, it becomes much more unsafe in the corner as it relies on pushback to keep you safe. 4 + 4 ? ? Triple Break (236236K/46K) A triple kick which send the opponent flying up into the air. Low damage but makes it incredibly easy to get juggle combos which can lead into Triple Break again. It's not difficult to learn practical combos that can lead to using all 3 bars of super on Triple Break. The speed and hitbox of Triple Break also allows for some cheeky conversions, making Allen incredibly explosive. A sample beginner combo may be 2LK 2MK 6MK Triple Break > Justice Fist > Triple Break > Justice Fist > Triple Break > Rising Dragon . This super is pretty much purely for combo applications, it has an awful hitbox for anti-airing and a lot of start up. 6 + 9 ? ? Gameplan Neutral Allen has a selection of decent pokes, with his 5LK , 5MK , 2MP and 2MK being the most useful. These buttons also can easily combo into 2HK or even 6MK into Triple Break or Fire Force, allowing him to cash out damage from his far reaching normals. 2HK by itself is great for its knockdown but is very bad to whiff given its long recovery. Allen also has a very solid fireball game allowing him to chip the opponent out and zone them. If they attempt to get around it with jumping, his Rising Dragon and 5HK allow him to knock the opponent out of the sky. His LP soul force in particular allows him to both control space and even let him run in very safely. Allen's fast walk speed and run speed allows him to quickly get ground on the opponent and lets him get his pokes into range. Offense Mix-Ups Allen doesn't have overhead normals or specials apart from MP+MK , so Allen relies on Frame Traps and Tick Throws along with his command grab (especially a to open a turtling opponent. His solid crossup kick also lets him get some left-right mixup on opponents recovering from a knockdown. Allen's solid chip options also means that it is no big loss for his strings to be blocked. Set-Ups Vaulting Kick into Fire Force Simple chip option from fullscreen, sadly you don't get time for much of a runup before the opponent recovers. Frame-Traps Any Delayed Chain As there is always a big window for you to chain one move to a higher strength, essentially any button can become a frame trap by simply delaying the next button just enough to allow a gap for an opponent to press a button that'll then get hit by your delayed button before their move can start up. The easiest way of practicing this by setting the training dummy to \"After First Hit\" and Guard All (Standing) or Guard All (Crouching), and setting either 5LP or 2LP in a slot for \"Recording Settings (After Guard). The dummy will try to jab their way out of any gaps and if you've delayed correctly, you'll hit the dummy out of the startup of their jab. 2MP or 2MK are great normals to try and frame trap from. 2MK/2MP > Soul Force Both these normals unchained have a gap that can be beaten out by 5f startup moves, Soul Foce will catch these normals and as it super cancels can start Triple Break Loop s. 5HP works as well, sadly 5HP still whiffs on some characters if they keep blocking while crouched, including Allen himself (Maybe a full list? Definitely works on D. Dark.) Justice Fist actually works if you feel like being a man and/or being at least -79 if you guess wrong. 5LK/2LK > 2HP A good route to catch people trying to throw through your strings and requires no manual timing. The only downside is that 2HP is -5 on standing block which is potentially punishable by 2LK from most characters which makes it weaker for dash-ins. However, 2LK > 2MK is a safe route that'll also catch someone attempting to stand block after a 2LK and there's always the threat of a delayed Fire Force to catch a potential 2LK punish. It's also possible to tech a throw in the case they attempt that as their punish. Dash-in 2LK > 5HK 5HK is an alternate ender for the previous route as it's -3 on standing block and if done point blank won't whiff on crouchers. This can still be punished with a throw but Allen can still tech the throw. Defense Allen's defensive play is decent. While not to the level of D.Dark, he can control the stage well with use of his Soul Forces and his 5HKs and Rising Dragons to catch people jumping over the Soul Forces. Unlike D.Dark he can't get combos from stray hits across the screen, so his damage output massively drops. If he has a life lead however and time is running out, he's still pretty good at keeping the opponent out and punishing them for poor approaches and/or winning through a timeout. Reversals Allen unlike most characters has access to a meterless reversal in his Rising Dragon . Unfortunately, he lacks a super cancel that'll keep him safe if the Rising Dragon is blocked. Ultimately this comes down to knowledge and knowing when it isn't working out for you. Allen takes a lot of decks with Guard Cancel and Guard Cancel allows him to Justice Fist his way out of pressure, making for an excellent combo starter. Rising Dragon can also work well as a guard cancel special since the invulnerability should let him get out of most followups to a string. Escapes Allen doesn't really have any special moves or supers that get him out of trouble. For the most part he needs to run away the old fashioned way or use his Reversals. Character Specific Techniques Combos As per all characters, Allen can chain from a normal to a higher strength normal, either punch or kick. Chains work off cancels, meaning that the button doesn't have to finish its animation and can go immediately to the next normal. When links are mentioned, that means the normal HAS to finish and then you can get the next normal to come out. These tend to be harder. His 6MK chains from every other normal. Bread And Butter Combos (Note: Almost all of these strings will work from a j.MK jumpin starter too.) Universal Strings 2/5LK > 2/5MK > 2HK A nice, safe and fairly rewarding chain as it scores you a knockdown and works off your standing or crouching kicks. 2/5LK > 2/5MK > (5HK) > 6MK > ( Triple Break Loop / Fire Force) A slightly more risky string as 6MK is poor on block. If the opponent is definitely standing, feel free to put the 5HK in for the extra damage. If the 6MK connects, rev up your Triple Break Loop . Whatever > Triple Break > Justice Fist > Triple Break > Justice Fist > Triple Break > Rising Dragon A nice and beginner friendly loop. While the individual parts are dangerous to drop, it is fairly easy to pull off regardless. It's extremely important to not end the combo with Justice Fist if it won't end the round, especially in the corner (and you will be in the corner, as this combo has fantastic corner carry.) Dash-In combos 2MP > 2MP > 2MK > Soul Force/6MK > ( Triple Break Loop / Fire Force) The momentum from your dash allows you to link (Not chain, so timing is a lot more strict) a second 2MP which can then link into 2MK . This is definitely more difficular than your chains and on blocks there's fairly noticeable gaps that the opponent can jab through. Mix it up with cancelling your 2MP s into Soul Force to frame trap them. A very respectable punish combo against very unsafe moves like Rising Dragons or many blocked supers. Hit-Confirms 2LK> 2MK > 6MK > Whatever If 6MK will be blocked, it's better to go into Soul Force or 2HK instead. Whatever > Soul Force Soul Force is both a decent blockstring ender and can go into both Fire Force or Triple Break, making it a no-brainer to cancel into from a chain of normals for the most part. Soul Force becomes way more unsafe in the corner however and so you'll prefer to end corner strings in 2HK . Anti-Air Conversions 5HK > Triple Break This allows Allen to potentially deal 50%+ off antiairs using a Triple Break Loop . Annoyingly, this can easily drop off max range 5HK connects, making it pretty risky to confirm. 5HK > Fire Force A less rewarding but much less unsafe super cancel. Depending on how you hit it, may just deal 1 hit or get the full 5 hits. If you have the spare meter, this is a pretty safe way of squeezing out extra damage. Make sure you delay it though, as the opponent can still sail over the Fire Force and punish it depending on how the 5HK hits. Rising Dragon > Triple Break This is very much on the ballsy side, but allows you to use Rising Dragon to get past jump-ins that beat your 5HK (And there's quite a few, such as Darun's j.HK, Shadowgeist's Shadow Sword Kick and Pullum Purna's Drill Purrus) and get your Triple Break Loop . Air to Air Conversions j.MK/HK > Triple Break Depending on both your height and the opponent's height, you can fairly often get Triple Break to catch them as they fall. As a rule, if you hit them as you're on your way up your jump, you'll probably not land in time for the Triple Break. j.MK/HK > 5HK > (Triple Break) 5HK will fairly often catch the opponent similarly to Triple Break but way less dangerous if it misses. j.MK/HK > Justice Fist > Triple Break Despite how dangerous the Justice Fist is to whiff, it actually works fairly reliably. The HP version of Justice Fist can often go under people and whiff, definitely practice this in training on a jumping opponent to get a feel for it. If you can land this, you can do 50% damage very easily off a basic full Triple Break Loop Triple Break Loops This is THE Allen Snider combo. Easily converts from any move that super cancels and repeated as long as you have the meter. Also gives you an opportunity to figure out what Allen is actually shouting (Four Two Kick? Fortune Break?). You can potentially squeeze more damage out by getting clean hits of Justice Fist, but really, it's best to make sure the combo is finished. Whatever > Triple Break > Justice Fist > Triple Break > Justice Fist > Triple Break > Rising Dragon As mentioned early, this is the basic Triple Break loop. Will work anywhere on the screen and deal roughly 40% damage. Whatever > Triple Break > 2MP > 5MK > Justice Fist > Triple Break > Justice Fist > Triple Break > Rising Dragon A slightly more optimal loop, corner only as 5MK will fall out midscreen. Sneaks in a bit more damage and also builds you more meter. Another corner variant is to do 5MP > 5HP > Justice Fist . Any of these extensions only work after the first Triple Break, just stick to Justice Fist after the 2 nd or third Triple Breaks. Whatever > Triple Break > 5LK > 5MK > 5HK > (in corner 6MK) > Triple Break > 5LK > 5MK > 5HK > (in corner 6MK) > Triple Break > Rising Dragon Another potential loop, the trick is to get the 5LK to hit late during the first loop but then do it quicker the second time. Builds a lot of meter, often allowing you to sneak in one more Triple Break than usual. Resources VODs Primers/Tutorials Allen Snider Primer by Hidden Gem. Somewhat outdated but still very useful. A small video on further optimizing Triple Break Loop juggles by starrich55. Tech Glossary Kara Cancel Kara Cancelling (Or \"Empty\" cancelling) is a fairly old fighting game glitch that lets you start up a move and then almost immediately input a more \"difficult\" action/move. The input system thinks you've done the simpler move by accident and lets you go straight into your more complicated move. In Allen's case, by Kara Cancelling 2HK and doing Vaulting Kick, you get the movement from the start of 2HK and then grab, teleporting Allen forward surprisingly far. You don't necessarily need to do anything tricky, just do it quickly and you'll see Allen suddenly scoot forward and maybe catch a few frames of the 2HK startup. A input that might work better would be 63K > 214K. Tick Throw Tick Throws are generally when you drop strings, often only doing jabs and attempted a delayed grab (do it instantly and the opponent will probably still have throw immunity from blockstun, causing the grab to whiff), catching a blocking opponent who is expecting a string to start or continue. Sadly, Allen doesn't get to enjoy being + after his jabs, but this is still a very effective way of sneaking in grabs while starting from a string, and it causes the opponent to second-guess blocking strings.","title":"Allen Snider"},{"location":"characters/allen-snider/#brief-overview","text":"","title":"Brief Overview"},{"location":"characters/allen-snider/#type-of-character","text":"Allen is a shotokan style character with a bit of a twist.

Special Cancel means you can cancel into Special Moves and Super Cancel means you can cancel into Super Moves. Link means you have to let the move finish first before you can do another move. An example is 2MP into 2MK where 2MP has to completely start up, hit and recover before the 2MK can come out. Lows are moves that have to be blocked crouching. Most crouching kicks hit low. Mids are moves that can blocked either crouching or standing. Almost all standing moves, special moves, supers and crouching punches hit mid. Highs/overheads are moves that must be blocked standing. Most jumping attacks and all Hard Attacks ( MP + MK ) hit high/overhead. FEXL runs at 60 frames per second, so 1 frame is a 60 th of a second. 2 frames would be 1/30 th etc. Startup means how long it takes for the move to actually hit. Active means how long the move will actually hit for before recovering. The more active frames the better as a rule. S.blo stands for standing block. In this case, it shows the difference in time between you recovering from your attack and the opponent recovering from blocking your attack. If it's 0, you both recover and can act at the same time. If it's -1 or lower, the opponent recovers faster and can act before you. If it's 1 or higher, you recover faster and can act before the opponent. C.blo is similar but when the opponent crouch blocks instead.","title":"Notation"},{"location":"characters/allen-snider/#normal-moves","text":"Normal Description Startup Active S.blo C.blo 5LP Allen's fastest normal with somewhat decent range, whiffs on crouchers Special Cancels. 4 2 -5 -1 5MP A fairly mediocre mid, 2MP is preferred.

The easiest way of practicing this by setting the training dummy to \"After First Hit\" and Guard All (Standing) or Guard All (Crouching), and setting either 5LP or 2LP in a slot for \"Recording Settings (After Guard). The dummy will try to jab their way out of any gaps and if you've delayed correctly, you'll hit the dummy out of the startup of their jab. 2MP or 2MK are great normals to try and frame trap from. 2MK/2MP > Soul Force Both these normals unchained have a gap that can be beaten out by 5f startup moves, Soul Foce will catch these normals and as it super cancels can start Triple Break Loop s. 5HP works as well, sadly 5HP still whiffs on some characters if they keep blocking while crouched, including Allen himself (Maybe a full list? Definitely works on D. Dark.) Justice Fist actually works if you feel like being a man and/or being at least -79 if you guess wrong. 5LK/2LK > 2HP A good route to catch people trying to throw through your strings and requires no manual timing. The only downside is that 2HP is -5 on standing block which is potentially punishable by 2LK from most characters which makes it weaker for dash-ins. However, 2LK > 2MK is a safe route that'll also catch someone attempting to stand block after a 2LK and there's always the threat of a delayed Fire Force to catch a potential 2LK punish. It's also possible to tech a throw in the case they attempt that as their punish. Dash-in 2LK > 5HK 5HK is an alternate ender for the previous route as it's -3 on standing block and if done point blank won't whiff on crouchers.

While he suffers from poor damage and some bad normals, Doctrine Dark dictates the pace of each match and frustrates the other player into making bad decisions which he can fully capitalize on. Strengths Strong defensive play with his Dark Wire, Dark Defender and EX-Plosive, shutting down many approachs from both air and ground. Dark Wire can be both combo'd out of and into, making it a great combo starter and combo linker. A decent suite of anti-air Normals and Specials and can often goad the enemy into jumping.

Fantastic setups if D.Dark gets the knockdown, even allowing him to get unblockables with the right setup and Gougi. Weaknesses Has quite a few stubby normals, making his strings fairly awkward and limited Very low damage even with meter, making him a poor comeback character Doesn't have particularly good ways of spending all his meter in a combo.

This'll often force them to jump. If they land or walk into EX-Plosive , it's often a free combo and even from faraway you can catch them with Dark Wire . You still want to be close enough that you can easily dash in to start your offense and also have EX-plosive threaten the opponent. If someone is jumping in on you, either do 5HK or 2HP .

This is also your crossup jump-in normal. D.Dark has some particularly awkward normals, so for chains stick to 2LK > 2MK > 2HK . The 2HK is almost completely safe so feel free to end blockstrings with it. If your chain hits, instead of 2HK , you can either do 6MK > Dark Shackle (236236K) or go from the 2MK into Dark Wire (236P). When you hit with Dark Wire , pull them in by doing Dark Hold (4P). If you want to activate G.Break by doing Hard Attack (MP + MK), you can easily do Hard Attack > Dark Knife . Otherwise, quickly dash forward (66) and immediately do 5LK > 5MK > 5HK > Dark Knife . If the opponent is knocked down, put a EX-Plosive on top or in front of them as they get up. Mix it up with his 2LK / 2MK , normal throws, Hard Attack and cross-up j.MK along with any gougi-specific mixups such as Hunting or Guard Break. Recommended Decks Shinobi Very solid Blue Gougi granting him an 5% damage increase and 10% speed increase almost immediately into the match. Guard Break is a perfect fit for D.Dark as not only does he get truly unblockable setups from it, but also is able to combo into Hard Attacks through Dark Wire very easily, making him far and away the best character to Trigger the Gougi. Ghost massively improves D.Dark's offense. It's also very easy to Trigger as D.Dark has the tools to zone out the opponent for 12 seconds right out of the gate. Guard Cancel as always is a fantastic defensive Gougi. This helps out D.Dark's poor defense. Stealth Raptor Very solid selection of Blue Gougi, the 2 Speed Ups boosts D.Dark's mobility by 20% while the Grab Up gives him a handy range increase, making his shimmying even stronger. Utsusemi helps with D.Dark's poor defense and lack of real escapes. Not on the level of Guard Cancel, but a decent defensive buff regardless. Hunting gives D.Dark a strong short hop, massively improving his mixup. Move Analysis Notation This guide uses Numpad notation.

For the special and super moves listed later on, the first input is the classic input, the second is the progressive input. Cancel means you can do something else as soon as your first move hits IE. 2MK on hit can go straight into a special move if you input the special move as 2MK would hit. Special Cancel means you can cancel into Special Moves and Super Cancel means you can cancel into Super Moves. Link means you have to let the move finish first before you can do another move. An example is 2MP into 2MK where 2MP has to completely start up, hit and recover before the 2MK can come out. Lows are moves that have to be blocked crouching. Most crouching kicks hit low. Mids are moves that can blocked either crouching or standing. Almost all standing moves, special moves, supers and crouching punches hit mid. Highs/overheads are moves that must be blocked standing. Most jumping attacks and all Hard Attacks ( MP + MK ) hit high/overhead. FEXL runs at 60 frames per second, so 1 frame is a 60 th of a second. 2 frames would be 1/30 th etc. Startup means how long it takes for the move to actually hit. Active means how long the move will actually hit for before recovering. The more active frames the better as a rule. S.blo stands for standing block. In this case, it shows the difference in time between you recovering from your attack and the opponent recovering from blocking your attack. If it's 0, you both recover and can act at the same time. If it's -1 or lower, the opponent recovers faster and can act before you. If it's 1 or higher, you recover faster and can act before the opponent. C.blo is similar but when the opponent crouch blocks instead.

Is his fastest normal however. Special and Super Cancellable. 4 -5 -1 5MP An advancing elbow strike with a deceptively large hitbox. Sadly whiffs on crouchers so not particularly useful in strings. Special and Super Cancellable. 6 -13 -9 5HP A short-range swing, has a fairly weird hitbox that'll sometimes whiff or hit depending on whether it's point blank or not, and this varies between characters. Not a great normal in any case. Super Cancellable. 9 -1 1 5LK A kick upwards, outside of point blank range will whiff on crouchers, can be used as a quick antiair if needs be but you're generally better off stick to `2HK` and `5HK` for that. Special and Super Cancellable. 5 -12 -8 5MK An advancing knee strike, short range but actually does hit crouchers, making it his most reliable standing normal for block strings. Special and Super Cancellable. 7 -12 -8 5HK A roundhouse kick. One of D.Dark's dedicated antiair buttons, has a pretty good range to it. This one is better if characters are jumping in from further away, but if the character is close enough to you `2HP` is preferred. Super Cancellable. 9 -2 0 2LP A quick jab with decent range, this is your preferred quick normal as it's only a frame slower than `5LP`. Special and Super Cancellable. 5 -5 -1 2MP A decent long range punch, one of your main combo starters along with `2LK` and `2MK`. Special and Super Cancellable. 6 -4 0 2HP A short ranged uppercut. D.Dark's other dedicated anti-air button, this one is better for opponents jumping right on top of you, with `5HK` being preferred for opponents jumping in from further away. Is also your most reliable heavy normal to chain into for combos as it doesn't whiff on crouchers, but you'll need to do it from a dash-in combo due to its poor range. Super Cancellable. 8 -8 -5 2LK A decent-ranged kick, D.Dark's quickest main combo starter normal and also his quickest Low. Pretty decent for tick throws as it's only -1 on block. Special and Super Cancellable. 5 Hits Low -1 2MK A long range kick that hits low, generally the normal to end your chain with before you cancel into a Dark Wire. In neutral, this is preferred over `2LK` as it has better range and damage and is only 1 frame slower. Special and Super Cancellable. 6 Hits Low -1 2HK A long range sweep, a solid block string ender as it is only -3. Also scores a knockdown which D.Dark thrives on, although unfortunately it isn't a hard knockdown, allowing the opponent to Recover. Is also the key to Kara-cancelling into EX-Plosive. Super Cancellable (however, no supers will combo from it.) 10 Hits Low -3 j.LP A downwards jab, is useful for setting up tick throws as it keeps them in blockstun for less time compared to `j.MP` and `j.HP`. Is also active for a fairly long time, making it good for anti-airing. 4 5 Hits Overhead j.MP A downwards jab, almost exactly the same as `j.HP` but does less damage so use that as your go-to move. 5 13 Hits Overhead j.HP Another downwards jab, use this over `j.MP`. 5 13 Hits Overhead j.LK A jumping knee strike, similarly to j.LP is pretty decent for tick throws. Is also active for a long time, making it a decent air-to-air. 5 5 Hits Overhead j.MK >D.Dark's crossup jump-in normal, also a pretty great air-to-air given its range. 4 13 Hits Overhead j.HK A dedicated air-to-air normal and what D.Dark uses in certain Dark Wire combos. 7 13 Hits Overhead Command Normals Command Normal Description Startup S.blo C.blo Death Spinkick (4MK) As per most command normals this can be chained into from any other normal and is super cancellable only. From a full chain into `Death Spinkick`, the best super to cancel into is `Dark Shackle` (236236K/46K) which leads to roughly 70 damage which is pretty decent for a bar of meter. However, Dark Wire confirms from strings are generally more safe, reliable and can potentially lead to more damage. Specific interactions with Gougi (IE. landing 4 Hard Attacks) also make Dark Wire routes generally the better option. Feel free to use `Death Spinkick` if you want a clean way to end the round and you only have 1 bar of meter to work. 18 -8 -4 Knife Nightmare(4MP) A faster overhead than Hard Attack but is neither special or super cancellable and is actually 0 on hit, meaning the opponent gets to act the same time you do. It can be chained into from any normal like `Death Spinkick`, so it can be used to insert a surprise overhead into chains. Given its shorter reach, this should be relegated to dash-in chains. As it's unsafe and there's no option of super cancelling to catch a punish, this is a move you should only throw out once or twice a match. 18 -10 -4 Shudder Blade (Hard Attack, MP+MK) D.Dark's universal overhead. As always, massively unsafe on block but is super cancellable and keeps them grounded on hit which allows him to get decent damage off a `Dark Shackle`. Can be combo'd into from a Dark Wire confirm and then into `Dark Knife` which is what allows D.Dark to get the Guard Break gougi Triggered easier than any other character. Has a strange interaction with `EX-plosive`, causing it to instantly go off as `Shudder Blade` starts up. Most likely intended to prevent easy unblockable setups. 28 -34 Hits Overhead Specials Special Move Description Startup S.blo C.blo Dark Wire (236P/4P) D.Dark sends out a wire that destroys projectiles and if it hits a grounded opponent, will latch onto them, allowing you to do `Dark Spark` or `Dark Hold`. The strength of the punch affects how far the wire will go. `Dark Hold` is almost always the better option, allowing you to pull the opponent in and extend your combo, Mortal Kombat's Scorpion style. Almost all of your grounded combos should lead in this move, and there's several extensions that are worth learning. 11/11/11 -24/-24/-24 -20/-20/-20 Dark Spark(After Dark Wire, do nothing) D.Dark sends out a spark that goes down the wire and deals fairly low damage to the opponent. Really, `Dark Hold` is what you should be using a majority of the time, although 'Dark Spark' finds its niche as a easy meterless knockdown in the corner. Super Cancellable. N/A N/A N/A Dark Hold(After Dark Wire, 4P) D.Dark pulls the opponent in, staggering them and allowing him to easily combo. This will only work if Dark Wire hit a grounded opponent. This is your main followup after a `Dark Wire`. A few things to note is that it is a fixed distance that the opponent stumbles, so certain combos (particularly combos involving j.HK as a starter) may need to be adjusted to still land. Also, the opponent is in a special state that means they won't be grounded after being hit. This prevents you from just doing yet another regular combo back into Dark Wire, but does still allow decent followups. Check the combo section below to figure out your followups. N/A N/A N/A Dark Defender(623P/3P) D.Dark sends out a wire at a 45 degree angle. The strength of the punch button affects how far the wire travels. A fairly decent anti-air that can lead into a solid juggle combo. If it hits an airborne opponent raw, it'll send them into a slow descending spiral. Otherwise, it'll knock them up slightly instead and cannot be followed up on except with a Super Cancel into `Dark Knife`. As a result, it's not a combo extension tool like `Dark Wire` but is an excellent anti-air combo starter. Use this to catch out obvious jump-ins, especially when the opponent is trying to get over a `EX-plosive`. 11/11/11 -6/-6/-6 Whiffs on crouchers. EX-plosive(236K/6K) D.Dark throws out a bomb directly in front of him. The bomb will explode on contact with the opponent, if D.Dark gets hit or after a certain amount of time. The strength of the kick determines how long it takes for the bomb to go off. Along with `Dark Wire`, this is D.Dark's main zoning tool, but is also used for many of his setups. Unless the bomb hits the opponent before it even gets to the ground, a hit can easily be followed up on. This is both good for catching people jumping or walking into it in neutral and using it as a meaty on a knocked down opponent. A regular `2LK` > `2MK` > etc. combo will work as normal off a successful bomb hit. Importantly it becomes even better if kara-cancelled from a `2HK`, giving the bomb toss more effective range and moving D.Dark forward. 13/13/13 -8/-8/-8 -5/-5/-5 Supers Quick note, in startup framedata (eg. x + y), x means the startup until Super Freeze and Y is the startup for the super to come out afterwards. Super Description Startup S.blo C.blo Dark Knife (236236P/46P) D.Dark does a series of uppercuts with his energy blade. Use this super as a combo tool on airborne/launched opponents (In particular, from a Dark Wire combo.. Unfortunately does very little damage but is mostly useful as it can score a hard knockdown on opponents, allowing you to have enough times to get your setups while the opponent is knocked down. Comes out slightly quicker than Dark Shackle, so is generally the better reversal. 3 + 2 ? ? Dark Shackle(236236K/46K) D.Dark does a series of thrusts with his energy blade before impaling and smashing them to the ground and then bombing them. Does fairly decent damage and is the super of choice on a grounded opponent. If for whatever reason you won't be doing a Dark Wire route, you'll be using this. 5 + 3 ? ? EX-prominence(236236K/46K) D.Dark throws out a massive bomb which detonates as it hits the ground. Has an incredibly slow startup and has a deceptively small vertical hitbox (basically the top half of the actual explosion doesn't count as a hitbox.) This usually can't be combo'd into outside of Dark Wire or Dark Defender either and if it lands cannot be combo'd out of. It is plus on block however. 7 + 33 ? ? Gameplan Neutral D.Dark doesn't have too many pokes given that a lot of his standing normals are very close ranged elbow and knee strikes. Use 2LK , 2MK and 2MP as your general normal pokes. D.Dark instead shines in neutral through use of his Dark Wire and EX-Plosive . The bombs can easily prevent grounded approaches and forces the opponent to take obvious jump arcs to avoid it, playing into D.Dark's anti-air game. His Dark Wire also destroys fireballs, forcing a stalemate against other fireball character. Unlike other fireball characters however, D.Dark can't really chip the opponent out from full screen, so he will need to eventually go on the offense. He has decent mobility but no dedicated moves to help him out and a standard jump arc which is why Gougi Decks such as Shinobi and Stealth Raptor help him out so much. Your general gameplan for most of D.Dark's Decks is to lame out the opponent for long enough to get Ghost at which point you'll mix it up between zoning and approaching the opponent. D.Dark's damage is very poor and he struggles to really dump his meter, so getting health leads and keeping them is key. Don't hesitate to use your offense and setups to get the health lead and then just stick to laming out the opponent. The threat of the short timer will also often coerce the opponent into making risky approaches, and D.Dark's EX-Plosive and the threat of his Dark Wire are perfect for capitalizing on that. For anti-airing, you'll want to stick to 2HP and 5HK . Dark Defender can be used but has a fairly awkward angle and is awful to whiff. Offense D.Dark isn't necessarily the best character to rush down an opponent with, but his defensive play often either allows him to approach easily or catch a frustrated enemy attempting to approach. If D.Dark can score a knockdown on the opponent, he can also enforce extremely strong mixups that lead into knockdowns as well. His deck choices are based on buffing his offense as a result. Mix-Ups D.Dark has incredibly solid mix ups and ways to force the mixup on opponents. You have access to the usual arsenal of quick low-hitting attacks, command Overheads ( Hard Attack and Knife Nightmare crossups, jumps into jumping normals that hit overhead or otherwise doing a empty jump into a low, frametraps and tick-throws. His EX-plosive placed as a meaty forces the opponent to block as they get up, giving D.Dark free reign to enforce his mixup. He does have 2 command overheads, but in particular if he takes a deck with Guard Break he gets access to a unblockable that leads to full combos and even gets unblockable setups. Set-Ups Hard Knockdown (From a Dark Knife for example) > EX-Plosive > Just block The most basic okizeme/vortex you can pull off, if an opponent is consistently attempt to mash/reversal out as they get back up, you'll be able to block them and combo them for free either as they come back down or from getting hit by the EX-Plosive . Otherwise, if they block in turn you have enough time to react and then continue your pressure on the blocking opponent In the corner, 2HK > Whiff 2LP > 236LK/236MK (EX-Plosive) A excellent setup which will be a meaty on both a normal getup and a Recover. If it connects, you can combo into 2MP / 2MK . Otherwise, you'll be +2 on crouching block or -1 on standing block. On a normal getup you'll also have enough time to set the bomb and block any reversals, including Allen's Rising Dragon and Blair Dame's Lightning Knee/Shoot Upper. The EX-Plosive will combo into Hard Attack as well, and if they block the bomb a Guard Break Hard Attack is almost guaranteed to land. (Credit to Labryz.) Frame-Traps Any Delayed Chain As there is always a big window for you to chain one move to a higher strength, essentially any button can become a frame trap by simply delaying the next button just enough to allow a gap for an opponent to press a button that'll then get hit by your delayed button before their move can start up. The easiest way of practicing this by setting the training dummy to \"After First Hit\" and Guard All (Standing) or Guard All (Crouching), and setting either 5LP or 2LP in a slot for \"Recording Settings (After Guard). The dummy will try to jab their way out of any gaps and if you've delayed correctly, you'll hit the dummy out of the startup of their jab. 2MP or 2MK are great normals to try and frame trap from. 2MK > 4MK A very nice frametrap for catching people jumping out of your pressure. Requires no manual timing and is a easy combo into Dark Knife . A sample string into this frametrap would be 2LK > 2MK > 4MK > Dark Knife on hit. 4MK unfortunately is fairly unsafe on block but since it's super cancellable you can still catch punish attempts. Dash-in 2MP > 2HP Requires a slightly delay, but is good for catching people attempting to throw you if you keep trying to link 2MP. from a dash-in. Defense Doctrine Dark's defensive play is strong from the start of the match. A backdash that covers a huge amount of ground allows him to quickly peel himself away from the opponent. It's a decent round opener. Once you have enough space, laying down a EX-Plosive makes it much more difficult for the opponent to approach. Opponents running into it without blocking or jumping on top of it keeps them grounded and is a free Dark Wire or Dash-in 2LK combo. The opponent can jump over it, but their jump arc will be much more obvious as they'll get to get clear over the bomb. D.Dark has a suite of good anti-airs to deal with this as well. His 2HP will catch opponents jumping in on top of him, while 2HK catches opponent jumping in from further away. Both of these can cancel into a Dark Knife and score a hard knockdown. Dark Defender , while having a fairly awkward arc, leads to a much stronger follow up (check the Dark Wire/Dark Defender Routes ). Dark Wire is both long ranged and pretty active so it makes a decent anti-air for jump-ins that neither your normals or Dark Defender could reach. D.Dark however doesn't completely zone out the opponent from anywhere on the screen. His Dark Wire isn't quite fullscreen and without the threat of a nearby EX-Plosive opponents can move forward safely. Playing fullscreen won't allow you to chip out an opponent or even effectively control space that well, so you want to make sure you're within around 2/3rds camera distance from the opponent as a rule. This also makes D.Dark a bit dangerous to play as. One wrong move and an opponent can be on top of you very quickly and pump out a lot more damage than D.Dark. He also lacks particularly good reversals or escapes, making him quite susceptible to other characters' vortex/pressure. Reversals D.Dark unfortunately has no meterless reversals. Dark Knife is probably your best bet due to its quick startup and potential to start your own vortex as it'll hard knockdown the opponent. Shinobi allows him to Guard Cancel, which massively buffs his options while blocking, either going immediately into a Dark Knife or pulling off a Dark Wire . Escapes D.Dark has a particularly good backdash that travels a long distance. While the usual weaknesses of being grounded for the duration and a lack of non-throw invuln still apply, D.Dark can be pretty slippery. Utsusemi (part of the Stealth Raptor deck) also heavily buffs his Recovery and makes potential backdashes and jump outs much less obvious. Character Specific Techniques Combos All characters can chain from a normal to a higher strength normal, either punch or kick. Chains work off cancels, meaning that the button doesn't have to finish its animation and can go immediately to the next normal. When links are mentioned, that means the normal HAS to finish and then you can get the next normal to come out. These tend to be harder. Unique/command normals chain from any normal. Bread And Butter Combos (Note: Almost all of these strings will work from jump in starters.) Universal Strings 2/5LK > 2/5MK > 2HK A nice, safe and fairly rewarding chain as it scores you a knockdown and works off your standing or crouching kicks. Becomes even better in the corner where even if the opponent Recovers, they still have to hold your mixup. 2/5LK > 2/5MK > (2HP) > 4MK > Dark Shackle The 2HP can be added if you're dashing in, otherwise it'll likely drop. A decent combo if you're catching the opponent grounded but generally getting into a Dark Wire Combo is preferred. Dark Wire/Dark Defender Routes 2/5LK > 2/5MK > Dark Wire > Dash-in 5MP > 5HK > Dark Knife The main bread and butter combo for D.Dark. You have to dash in with the 5MP as otherwise when you cancel into Dark Knife , the opponent will be too far away. j.HP/j.HK, dash-in 5MP > 5HK > (In Corner, 4MK) > Dark Knife Similar to the combo before but is a bit more finicky and spacing dependent. You'll want to be closer to your opponent, but too close and you'll either jump too far back or otherwise jump over the opponent. If the opponent is more than a half screen away, you'll mostly likely need to jump straight up instead of back. Dark Hold > EX-Prominence A potential route to take if you land a full screen Dark Wire. The opponent gets to stumble into EX-Prominence and is one of the few times you'll get to combo into it. 2/5LK > 2/5MK > Dark Wire > Hard Attack > Dark Knife Another route, this one is mainly useful for activating Guard Break as the Hard Attack is guaranteed to combo. (In the corner) dash-in 5MP > 5HK > 4MK > Dark Knife A corner only variant which does good damage and is a lot less awkward than pulling off a j.HK close to the corner. Dash-In combos 2MP > 2MP > 2MK > Dark Wire Route The momentum from your dash allows you to link (Not chain, so timing is a lot more strict) a second 2MP which can then link into 2MK . This is definitely more difficult than your chains and on blocks there's fairly noticeable gaps that the opponent can jab through. Mix it up with cancelling your 2MP s into a slightly delayed 2HP . Hit-Confirms D.Dark's normal combo routes unfortunately end with unsafe specials or supers. For the most part, ending your combo routes in 2HK is the way to go. Anti-Air Conversions 5HK/2HP > Dark Knife A easy and consistent route that leads to a hard knockdown. Dark Defender > EX-Plosive > Dash-in 5MP > 5HK > Dark Knife A easy enough conversion to make from Dark Defender which leads to a hard knockdown. Air to Air Conversions Air-To-Air Normal > (5HK) > Dark Knife As D.Dark has no air supers, he relies on this height dependent route, and it's entirely possible that the opponent will land before you do. Your safest bet is to try and combo into 5HK and THEN go into Dark Knife . Spending More than 1 bar Dark Shackle > Dark Knife > Dark Shackle D.Dark isn't particularly good at dumping all his meter into a combo. From a grounded hit, this is the best 3 super route to make. You'll want to cancel into the second Dark Shackle before the Dark Knife can launch the opponent so you can hit Dark Shackle grounded and get the second part of the super. If the opponent is airborne, you can invert the combo ( Dark Knife > Dark Shackle > Dark Knife ) but this is even less damage. Dark Knife > EX-Prominence Another grounded route, this time from Dark Knife which will most likely be from when you use it as a reversal. On the fourth hit, as D.Dark is about to make his second uppercut lunge, cancel into the EX-Prominence.

A combination of wires and mines allow him to constrict the opponent's movement options very easily and also let him get full combos off any confirm. While he suffers from poor damage and some bad normals, Doctrine Dark dictates the pace of each match and frustrates the other player into making bad decisions which he can fully capitalize on. Strengths Strong defensive play with his Dark Wire, Dark Defender and EX-Plosive, shutting down many approachs from both air and ground. Dark Wire can be both combo'd out of and into, making it a great combo starter and combo linker. A decent suite of anti-air Normals and Specials and can often goad the enemy into jumping. With the right gougi, can easily play both very defensively and very offensively, switching as needed. Fantastic setups if D.Dark gets the knockdown, even allowing him to get unblockables with the right setup and Gougi. Weaknesses Has quite a few stubby normals, making his strings fairly awkward and limited Very low damage even with meter, making him a poor comeback character Doesn't have particularly good ways of spending all his meter in a combo.

This'll often force them to jump. If they land or walk into EX-Plosive , it's often a free combo and even from faraway you can catch them with Dark Wire .

For the special and super moves listed later on, the first input is the classic input, the second is the progressive input. Cancel means you can do something else as soon as your first move hits IE. 2MK on hit can go straight into a special move if you input the special move as 2MK would hit. Special Cancel means you can cancel into Special Moves and Super Cancel means you can cancel into Super Moves. Link means you have to let the move finish first before you can do another move. An example is 2MP into 2MK where 2MP has to completely start up, hit and recover before the 2MK can come out. Lows are moves that have to be blocked crouching. Most crouching kicks hit low. Mids are moves that can blocked either crouching or standing. Almost all standing moves, special moves, supers and crouching punches hit mid. Highs/overheads are moves that must be blocked standing. Most jumping attacks and all Hard Attacks ( MP + MK ) hit high/overhead. FEXL runs at 60 frames per second, so 1 frame is a 60 th of a second. 2 frames would be 1/30 th etc. Startup means how long it takes for the move to actually hit. Active means how long the move will actually hit for before recovering. The more active frames the better as a rule. S.blo stands for standing block. In this case, it shows the difference in time between you recovering from your attack and the opponent recovering from blocking your attack. If it's 0, you both recover and can act at the same time. If it's -1 or lower, the opponent recovers faster and can act before you. If it's 1 or higher, you recover faster and can act before the opponent. C.blo is similar but when the opponent crouch blocks instead.

Special and Super Cancellable. 6 -13 -9 5HP A short-range swing, has a fairly weird hitbox that'll sometimes whiff or hit depending on whether it's point blank or not, and this varies between characters. Not a great normal in any case. Super Cancellable. 9 -1 1 5LK A kick upwards, outside of point blank range will whiff on crouchers, can be used as a quick antiair if needs be but you're generally better off stick to `2HK` and `5HK` for that. Special and Super Cancellable. 5 -12 -8 5MK An advancing knee strike, short range but actually does hit crouchers, making it his most reliable standing normal for block strings. Special and Super Cancellable. 7 -12 -8 5HK A roundhouse kick. One of D.Dark's dedicated antiair buttons, has a pretty good range to it. This one is better if characters are jumping in from further away, but if the character is close enough to you `2HP` is preferred. Super Cancellable. 9 -2 0 2LP A quick jab with decent range, this is your preferred quick normal as it's only a frame slower than `5LP`. Special and Super Cancellable. 5 -5 -1 2MP A decent long range punch, one of your main combo starters along with `2LK` and `2MK`. Special and Super Cancellable. 6 -4 0 2HP A short ranged uppercut. D.Dark's other dedicated anti-air button, this one is better for opponents jumping right on top of you, with `5HK` being preferred for opponents jumping in from further away. Is also your most reliable heavy normal to chain into for combos as it doesn't whiff on crouchers, but you'll need to do it from a dash-in combo due to its poor range. Super Cancellable. 8 -8 -5 2LK A decent-ranged kick, D.Dark's quickest main combo starter normal and also his quickest Low. Pretty decent for tick throws as it's only -1 on block. Special and Super Cancellable. 5 Hits Low -1 2MK A long range kick that hits low, generally the normal to end your chain with before you cancel into a Dark Wire. In neutral, this is preferred over `2LK` as it has better range and damage and is only 1 frame slower. Special and Super Cancellable. 6 Hits Low -1 2HK A long range sweep, a solid block string ender as it is only -3. Also scores a knockdown which D.Dark thrives on, although unfortunately it isn't a hard knockdown, allowing the opponent to Recover. Is also the key to Kara-cancelling into EX-Plosive. Super Cancellable (however, no supers will combo from it.) 10 Hits Low -3 j.LP A downwards jab, is useful for setting up tick throws as it keeps them in blockstun for less time compared to `j.MP` and `j.HP`. Is also active for a fairly long time, making it good for anti-airing. 4 5 Hits Overhead j.MP A downwards jab, almost exactly the same as `j.HP` but does less damage so use that as your go-to move. 5 13 Hits Overhead j.HP Another downwards jab, use this over `j.MP`. 5 13 Hits Overhead j.LK A jumping knee strike, similarly to j.LP is pretty decent for tick throws. Is also active for a long time, making it a decent air-to-air. 5 5 Hits Overhead j.MK >D.Dark's crossup jump-in normal, also a pretty great air-to-air given its range. 4 13 Hits Overhead j.HK A dedicated air-to-air normal and what D.Dark uses in certain Dark Wire combos. 7 13 Hits Overhead","title":"Normal Moves"},{"location":"characters/doctrine-dark/#command-normals","text":"Command Normal Description Startup S.blo C.blo Death Spinkick (4MK) As per most command normals this can be chained into from any other normal and is super cancellable only. From a full chain into `Death Spinkick`, the best super to cancel into is `Dark Shackle` (236236K/46K) which leads to roughly 70 damage which is pretty decent for a bar of meter. However, Dark Wire confirms from strings are generally more safe, reliable and can potentially lead to more damage. Specific interactions with Gougi (IE. landing 4 Hard Attacks) also make Dark Wire routes generally the better option. Feel free to use `Death Spinkick` if you want a clean way to end the round and you only have 1 bar of meter to work. 18 -8 -4 Knife Nightmare(4MP) A faster overhead than Hard Attack but is neither special or super cancellable and is actually 0 on hit, meaning the opponent gets to act the same time you do. It can be chained into from any normal like `Death Spinkick`, so it can be used to insert a surprise overhead into chains. Given its shorter reach, this should be relegated to dash-in chains. As it's unsafe and there's no option of super cancelling to catch a punish, this is a move you should only throw out once or twice a match. 18 -10 -4 Shudder Blade (Hard Attack, MP+MK) D.Dark's universal overhead. As always, massively unsafe on block but is super cancellable and keeps them grounded on hit which allows him to get decent damage off a `Dark Shackle`. Can be combo'd into from a Dark Wire confirm and then into `Dark Knife` which is what allows D.Dark to get the Guard Break gougi Triggered easier than any other character. Has a strange interaction with `EX-plosive`, causing it to instantly go off as `Shudder Blade` starts up. Most likely intended to prevent easy unblockable setups. 28 -34 Hits Overhead","title":"Command Normals"},{"location":"characters/doctrine-dark/#specials","text":"Special Move Description Startup S.blo C.blo Dark Wire (236P/4P) D.Dark sends out a wire that destroys projectiles and if it hits a grounded opponent, will latch onto them, allowing you to do `Dark Spark` or `Dark Hold`. The strength of the punch affects how far the wire will go. `Dark Hold` is almost always the better option, allowing you to pull the opponent in and extend your combo, Mortal Kombat's Scorpion style. Almost all of your grounded combos should lead in this move, and there's several extensions that are worth learning. 11/11/11 -24/-24/-24 -20/-20/-20 Dark Spark(After Dark Wire, do nothing) D.Dark sends out a spark that goes down the wire and deals fairly low damage to the opponent. Really, `Dark Hold` is what you should be using a majority of the time, although 'Dark Spark' finds its niche as a easy meterless knockdown in the corner. Super Cancellable. N/A N/A N/A Dark Hold(After Dark Wire, 4P) D.Dark pulls the opponent in, staggering them and allowing him to easily combo. This will only work if Dark Wire hit a grounded opponent. This is your main followup after a `Dark Wire`. A few things to note is that it is a fixed distance that the opponent stumbles, so certain combos (particularly combos involving j.HK as a starter) may need to be adjusted to still land. Also, the opponent is in a special state that means they won't be grounded after being hit. This prevents you from just doing yet another regular combo back into Dark Wire, but does still allow decent followups. Check the combo section below to figure out your followups. N/A N/A N/A Dark Defender(623P/3P) D.Dark sends out a wire at a 45 degree angle. The strength of the punch button affects how far the wire travels. A fairly decent anti-air that can lead into a solid juggle combo. If it hits an airborne opponent raw, it'll send them into a slow descending spiral. Otherwise, it'll knock them up slightly instead and cannot be followed up on except with a Super Cancel into `Dark Knife`. As a result, it's not a combo extension tool like `Dark Wire` but is an excellent anti-air combo starter. Use this to catch out obvious jump-ins, especially when the opponent is trying to get over a `EX-plosive`. 11/11/11 -6/-6/-6 Whiffs on crouchers. EX-plosive(236K/6K) D.Dark throws out a bomb directly in front of him. The bomb will explode on contact with the opponent, if D.Dark gets hit or after a certain amount of time. The strength of the kick determines how long it takes for the bomb to go off. Along with `Dark Wire`, this is D.Dark's main zoning tool, but is also used for many of his setups. Unless the bomb hits the opponent before it even gets to the ground, a hit can easily be followed up on. This is both good for catching people jumping or walking into it in neutral and using it as a meaty on a knocked down opponent. A regular `2LK` > `2MK` > etc. combo will work as normal off a successful bomb hit. Importantly it becomes even better if kara-cancelled from a `2HK`, giving the bomb toss more effective range and moving D.Dark forward. 13/13/13 -8/-8/-8 -5/-5/-5","title":"Specials"},{"location":"characters/doctrine-dark/#supers","text":"Quick note, in startup framedata (eg. x + y), x means the startup until Super Freeze and Y is the startup for the super to come out afterwards.

Use 2LK , 2MK and 2MP as your general normal pokes. D.Dark instead shines in neutral through use of his Dark Wire and EX-Plosive . The bombs can easily prevent grounded approaches and forces the opponent to take obvious jump arcs to avoid it, playing into D.Dark's anti-air game. His Dark Wire also destroys fireballs, forcing a stalemate against other fireball character. Unlike other fireball characters however, D.Dark can't really chip the opponent out from full screen, so he will need to eventually go on the offense. He has decent mobility but no dedicated moves to help him out and a standard jump arc which is why Gougi Decks such as Shinobi and Stealth Raptor help him out so much. Your general gameplan for most of D.Dark's Decks is to lame out the opponent for long enough to get Ghost at which point you'll mix it up between zoning and approaching the opponent. D.Dark's damage is very poor and he struggles to really dump his meter, so getting health leads and keeping them is key. Don't hesitate to use your offense and setups to get the health lead and then just stick to laming out the opponent. The threat of the short timer will also often coerce the opponent into making risky approaches, and D.Dark's EX-Plosive and the threat of his Dark Wire are perfect for capitalizing on that.

The easiest way of practicing this by setting the training dummy to \"After First Hit\" and Guard All (Standing) or Guard All (Crouching), and setting either 5LP or 2LP in a slot for \"Recording Settings (After Guard). The dummy will try to jab their way out of any gaps and if you've delayed correctly, you'll hit the dummy out of the startup of their jab. 2MP or 2MK are great normals to try and frame trap from. 2MK > 4MK A very nice frametrap for catching people jumping out of your pressure.

A backdash that covers a huge amount of ground allows him to quickly peel himself away from the opponent. It's a decent round opener. Once you have enough space, laying down a EX-Plosive makes it much more difficult for the opponent to approach. Opponents running into it without blocking or jumping on top of it keeps them grounded and is a free Dark Wire or Dash-in 2LK combo. The opponent can jump over it, but their jump arc will be much more obvious as they'll get to get clear over the bomb. D.Dark has a suite of good anti-airs to deal with this as well. His 2HP will catch opponents jumping in on top of him, while 2HK catches opponent jumping in from further away. Both of these can cancel into a Dark Knife and score a hard knockdown. Dark Defender , while having a fairly awkward arc, leads to a much stronger follow up (check the Dark Wire/Dark Defender Routes ). Dark Wire is both long ranged and pretty active so it makes a decent anti-air for jump-ins that neither your normals or Dark Defender could reach. D.Dark however doesn't completely zone out the opponent from anywhere on the screen. His Dark Wire isn't quite fullscreen and without the threat of a nearby EX-Plosive opponents can move forward safely. Playing fullscreen won't allow you to chip out an opponent or even effectively control space that well, so you want to make sure you're within around 2/3rds camera distance from the opponent as a rule. This also makes D.Dark a bit dangerous to play as. One wrong move and an opponent can be on top of you very quickly and pump out a lot more damage than D.Dark.

Frame-Traps Any Delayed Chain As there is always a big window for you to chain one move to a higher strength, essentially any button can become a frame trap by simply delaying the next button just enough to allow a gap for an opponent to press a button that'll then get hit by your delayed button before their move can start up. The easiest way of practicing this by setting the training dummy to \"After First Hit\" and Guard All (Standing) or Guard All (Crouching), and setting either 5LP or 2LP in a slot for \"Recording Settings (After Guard). The dummy will try to jab their way out of any gaps and if you've delayed correctly, you'll hit the dummy out of the startup of their jab. 2MP or 2MK are great normals to try and frame trap from. Some normal > Other normal or special Specific examples. Defense Does your character have anything interesting outside of the normal defensive routes (it's good to note normal defense regardless).

Teleports for example? Any Gougi that helps? Character Specific Techniques Combos All characters can chain from a normal to a higher strength normal, either punch or kick. Chains work off cancels, meaning that the button doesn't have to finish its animation and can go immediately to the next normal. When links are mentioned, that means the normal HAS to finish and then you can get the next normal to come out. These tend to be harder. Unique/command normals chain from any normal. Bread And Butter Combos (Note: Almost all of these strings will work from jump in starters.) Universal Strings 2/5LK > 2/5MK > 2HK A nice, safe(?) and fairly rewarding chain as it scores you a knockdown and works off your standing or crouching kicks. 2/5LK > 2/5MK > Command Normal > (Special/Super) A slightly more risky string as Command Normal is poor on block. 2/5LK > 2/5MK > Special > Super A nice and beginner friendly combo. Drop the combo at the special. Dash-In combos 2MP > 2MP > 2MK > Special/Command Normal > ( Example Super Loop / Other Super) The momentum from your dash allows you to link (Not chain, so timing is a lot more strict) a second 2MP which can then link into 2MK . This is definitely more difficular than your chains and on blocks there's fairly noticeable gaps that the opponent can jab through. Mix it up with cancelling your 2MP s into Something .

He has access to a slow short-ranged multi-hit fireball, a command dash, a command short hop, a simple rekka series and 2 different kinds of counter moves. He lacks Unique Normals aside from Hard Attack and has some strange normals, making his strings slightly different. His damage is somewhat low and isn't able to dump his meter into high damage like some other characters. Despite this, he has THE best vortex in the game and fantastic mixup, causing him to keep the pressure on opponents even after they get up and can often open the opponent back up and starting his vortex all over again. Vulcano Rosso is the character to play if you like being able to put the other character into a blender, forcing the opponent to try and block both Low/Overhead and left/right, and playing with a eclectic selection of Special Moves. Strengths Extremely strong vortex that can lead back into itself. Superb mix up with his command dash and command short hop, allows him to convert his pressure into a full combo. - Strong anti-air normals with fairly decent conversions - Good mobility with decent walk speed and run speed and a command dash Weaknesses Somewhat low damage even with meter, struggles to cash in more than one bar of meter in a combo. No real fireball game, forcing him to be up close to get anything done Outside of setups with Vulcanus, lacks a lot of ways to end blockstrings safely other than cutting them short. Has to rely on using his counters to catch punish attempts or attempting frame traps with his Rekka series. Right pain in the arse to refer to his move by their actual names. 5 Minute Guide (if you don't know what the abbreviations mean, check the notation guide below.) Take Shinobi as your deck, if you can activate its gougi will let you turn invisible, make your Hard Attack (MP+MK) unblockable and lets you do Specials and Supers out of blockstun. To quickly activate Ghost, keep the opponent away for 12 seconds at the start of the match with 214P 2LK, 2MP, 2MK, 5HK are all good buttons to poke with. If someone is jumping in on you, either do 5MK or 2HP. If you land either of these as an antiair, 214214P is a good way of getting damage to score a knockdown. For jumping in, use j.MK as it does 2 hits. For combos, start off with light kicks or punches, move up to medium kicks or punches and then to hard kicks or punches. Easiest one is 2LK > 2MK > 2HK. If your combo lands, as long as you haven't done 2HK yet you can do 236P, and then follow up with P and K immediately afterwards to a second punch and a kick, sending the opponent flying to the corner. If you have a bar of Meter, do the second punch and then cancel to 214214P. If the opponent is knocked down, either close the gap with 236K, or do 214P (ideally the MP or HP version) to force the opponent to block as they get up. You can also mix it up with PP (a short hop that lets you hit overhead extremely quickly with K) and 214HK to zip past the opponent along with the usual low hitting moves and throws to open up the opponent. If you can open them up, try to combo so that you put them right back in the same situation. For the most part you can ignore his counters. The KK counter lets you stop a projectile and do a quick dash attack that can be cancelled into a super like 236236K or 236236P. The best combo to learn immediately is 2LK > 2MK > 236P > P > K or instead do 2LK > 2MK > 236P > P > 214214P if you have the meter. Recommended Decks Shinobi Very solid Blue Gougi granting him an 5% damage increase and 10% speed increase almost immediately into the match. Guard Cancel as always is a fantastic defensive Gougi. Vulcano Rosso struggles to spend meter as is, so doesn't mind spending the bar either on his Rage of Vesuvio or his counters, Umiliazione Di Canossa. Guard Break allows Vulcano Russo to set up difficult to escape unblockable situations and get huge rewards. Doesn't quite get to land the Hard Attacks for free like D.Dark does, but is still not too bad at sneaking them in. Ghost makes approaching much easier for Vulcano Russo, allowing him to start enforcing his pressure and vortex much more reliably. Once he's in, a quick dash makes his mixup even scarier and unpredictable. Is also fairly good at stalling for the 12 seconds needed to Trigger the Ghost with his 214P which is pretty good at preventing the opponent from rushing in. Stealth Raptor Very solid selection of Blue Gougi, the 2 Speed Ups boosts V.Rosso's mobility by 20% while the Grab Up gives him a handy range increase, making his shimmying even stronger. Utsusemi helps with V.Rosso's lackluster defense and prevents a lot of other characters from enforcing their vortex and mixup on Rosso himself. Hunting Dash gives Rosso a even better Short Hop with a different timing. Infinity Probably the best Blue Gougi of any deck, allowing you to get 130% meter gain near instantly. This lets V.Rosso get the bars needed for Guard Cancel and his combos into his Torre Pendente Di Pisa so he can ensure a hard knockdown. Guard Cancel as always is a fantastic defensive Gougi. Vulcano Rosso struggles to spend meter as is, so doesn't mind spending the bar either on his Rage of Vesuvio or his counters, Umiliazione Di Canossa. His command hop is also very nice for punishing easy Low blockstrings. Rage is a very nice buff for Rosso's meter gain. While Rosso isn't fantastic at spending a lot of meter, always having the bar for his Torre Pendente Di Pisa and Guard Cancels is incredibly useful While this isn't the absolute best fit for Rosso, the deck itself is so strong that it's still probably his go-to Deck outside of Shinobi and is by far the easiest one to make use out of. Nightmare Very easy Blue Gougi to Trigger, getting a permanent 20% Speed boost with 2 Speed Ups after only 10 seconds into the match is ideal for Rosso. Ghost just like with Shinobi is an easy Yellow Gougi to Trigger with an amazing Effect that massively buffs Rosso's approach and Mix Up. Energy Drain is the main difference between taking Shinobi and taking Nightmare. Rosso can very easily score the 4 knockdowns needed for Energy Drain, and its Effect gives Rosso both a source of Meter Gain and also gets rid of meter from the opponent that they could otherwise use for Guard Cancels or Reversal Supers. Soul Drain is honestly icing on the cake and is most likely going to be Triggered in the final round, but it makes his pressure even more disgusting, shredding the enemy of their Health and Meter. This is fairly similar to Shinobi, but while Shinobi has more utility with Guard Break and especially Guard Cancel, Nightmare makes his vortex even stronger and rewarding with a powerful late-game Effect in his Soul Drain. Move Analysis Notation This guide uses Numpad notation. That means that directions correspond to the numbers on your keyboard numpad (ie. 6 is right, 4 is left, 8 is up, 2 is down). 5 means no direction held. For example, the classic Hadoken quartercircle motion would look like 236, the classic Tatsumaki/Hurricane Kick motion is 214 and the classic Shoryuken motion is 623.

An example is 2MP into 2MK where 2MP has to completely start up, hit and recover before the 2MK can come out. Lows are moves that have to be blocked crouching. Most crouching kicks hit low. Mids are moves that can blocked either crouching or standing. Almost all standing moves, special moves, supers and crouching punches hit mid. Highs/overheads are moves that must be blocked standing. Most jumping attacks and all Hard Attacks ( MP + MK ) hit high/overhead. FEXL runs at 60 frames per second, so 1 frame is a 60 th of a second. 2 frames would be 1/30 th etc. Startup means how long it takes for the move to actually hit.

Super Cancels. Doesn't whiff on crouchers. ? ? ? 2LK Similar to 2LP, a solid long range poke, very nice from dash-ins and is a good starter for combos as it chain into his 2MP and 2MK. The preferred crouching Light Normal. ? ? ? 2MK Another mainstay normal for Vulcano Russo, good reach and speed, can be linked into from 2MP. Usually your last normal in a combo before you go into Rage of Vesuvio, your rekka.

Doesn't cancel. ? ? ? j.LP A downward reaching aerial jab. Only really useful for setting up a tick throw as it has little blockstun attached. ? ? ? j.MP Similar to j.LP except it has a lot more hitstun and blockstun, a okay jump in normal. ? ? ? j.HP Again, similar to j.MP but slightly slower, does more damage (15 compared to j.HP's 22). For the most part the jumping kick normals are the better option. ? ? ? j.LK Crosses up and comes out quick, a very useful part of Vulcano Rosso's mixup. ? ? ? j.MK Doesn't cross up but does have 2 hits, odd for a jumping normal. This can really mess up the opponent who only expects to block 1 overhead hit, very useful as a jump in to mix up the opponent. ? ? ? j.HK A solid air-to-air that actually has 2 hits, the second hit taking a very long time to come out. Is generally the best aerial normal to actually convert from into a Super on the ground. ? ? ? Command Normals Command Normal Description Startup S.blo C.blo MP+MK (Hard Attack) Vulcano Rosso's only Unique Normal. As a Hard Attack it is fairly quick and can actually get over low attacks decently well. Also is one of the better characters to attempt a Hard Attack with. ? ? ? Specials Special Move Description Startup S.blo C.blo Sciara Del Fuoco (236K/6K) A command dash, Vulcano Rosso dashes forward and turns to flames before returning to normal, the strength of the punch affects how far Vulcano Russo travels.. Has no invulnability(?) but can actually dash through the other character, making it excellent for switching sides and mixing up the opponent. ?/?/? ?/?/? ?/?/? Le Ali Di Aero(PP/PP) A command shorthop, Vulcano Rosso jumps up slightly but much less than a regular jump. Holding forward makes him jump forward slightly too. With the Follow up Rage of Etna, this lets Vulcano Rosso pull off an overhead much faster than many other characters. ?/?/? ?/?/? ?/?/? Rage of Etna(K/K during Le Ali Di Aero) Vulcano Rosso's followup kick, is extremely quick and has decent range and hitstun. Basically use it as a jump-in and follow it up with a regular combo. ?/?/? ?/?/? ?/?/? Vulcanus(214P/4P) A slow and short ranged fireball, the strength of the punch affects the startup and number of hits the fireball has (1, 3 and 5 respectively). This is the cornerstone of Vulcano Rosso's pressure and vortex. While it can't be used the same way a normal fire ball can, it's fantastic to use on knocked down opponents and basically lets you mix up the opponent for completely free as they're stuck blocking the Vulcanus. Get used to doing this whenever you knock the opponent down. ?/?/? ?/?/? ?/?/? Rage of Vesuvio(236P,P,K/6P,P,K) Vulcano Rosso's Rekka, the first command does an advancing punch, the second an uppercut that launches the opponent off the ground slightly and the third doing a rising dragon kick that sends the opponent flying to the corner. The strength of the punch determines the startup and distance the first hit travels. This is the special you want to combo into. Doing the full command is your best meterless option, but if you have 1 bar of meter, it's well worth Super Cancelling into Torre Pendente Di Pisa (214214P) after the second P to allow you to dash forward and apply Vortex as the opponent is still flying after you recover from the Super. The first command is somewhat unsafe on block, with the next 2 becoming much more unsafe, so make sure you stop doing the command if the first hit is blocked. Notably, you can cancel this Special into your counter, Umiliazione Di Canossa and potentially catch the punish attempt from the opponent. ?/?/? ?/?/? ?/?/? Umiliazione Di Canossa(214K/4K) A counter move that makes Vulcano Russo pose and will do an automatic counter attack if it blocks the right kind of normal. The strength of the kick determines whether you block Overheads, Mids or Lows respectively. The the Mid and Overhead counter can be followed up with by a normal (use 2MP or 2MK) allowing for some decent damage. The Low counter does an special counter attack that cannot be followed up on. This takes some time to start up, so it's a pretty bad idea to do as you're getting up as any proper meaty attempt will beat it out. ?/?/? ?/?/? ?/?/? Regalo(KK/KK) Vulcano Rosso's other counter move, this one stops projectiles and does an automatic long reaching dash punch that can be Super Cancelled. Pretty good for what it does, but an opponent depending on timing and spacing can actually block or completely beat out the automatic counter move. ?/?/? ?/?/? ?/?/? Supers Quick note, in startup framedata (eg. x + y), x means the startup until Super Freeze and Y is the startup for the super to come out afterwards. Super Description Startup S.blo C.blo Ponte Dei Sospiri (236236P/46P) A series of punches that ends with a series of curbstomps on grounded opponents. Fairly quick and with decent reach and leaves you in a good position for your vortex. However, for setting up vortex Torre Pendente Di Pisa is much better as it sends the opponent the perfect distance off an aerial hit which is easily combo'd into from the second hit of Rage of Vesuvio, so this is usually better if you cannot get the opponent off the ground during a combo (IE. You've ended your chain in a heavy attack). Probably the best super to use as a reversal. ? + ? ? ? Torre Pendente Di Pisa(214214P/64P) A 6 hit pillar of flame sent out at an angle. A semi decent anti-air but really finds its niche as the best super to use on opponents that have been sent into the air by another anti-air or air-to air or combo. If instantly cancelled into from the second hti of Rage of Vesuvio, it sends the opponent spiralling upwards at the perfect height to easily follow up on from anywhere on the screen. This becomes even better in the corner, and is probably what you'll be spending your bar on along with any Gougi that use it, like Stealth Raptor. Not great for going into other supers, but Rosso doesn't really have a good sequence of supers to do in a combo anyway. ? + ? ? ? Accelerando(214214K/64K) A series of kicks into a series of punches. The 13 th hit knocks down. This Super is mostly useful to string into other supers as it has a pretty short range but does have a lot of hits to get your Super Cancel in. Unfortunately, this really leads to very lackluster damage (62 damage going from Accelerando to Ponte Dei Sospiri back to Accelerando, very poor for 3 bars.) and you're probably best keeping your meter. ? + ? ? ? Gameplan Neutral Rosso wants to mainly use his crouching normals and 2LK to poke and approach, as his 5MK is a dedicated anti-air that easily whiffs on crouchers. Rosso lacks a faraway fireball game, but can still somewhat zone opponents with his Vulcanus(214P/4P). If you've taken a deck with Ghost, you want to try to lame the opponent out at the start of the match until you Trigger Ghost. Against other characters fireball game (or other specials with long range), you can attempt to use your counters to get the jump on the opponent. Ideally try to approach the traditional way with running in and blocking unless you really have the read with your counters. For anti-airing, your 5MK and 2HP are pretty excellent normals that can be both Super Cancelled into Torre Pendente Di Pisa (214214P/64P), leading to his setups. Vulcano Rosso has fantastic walk speed and run speed, with a quick low jump. This makes his jump approaches harder to react to. You need to use his mobility as Rosso thrives up close. Offense Mix-Ups Vulcano Rosso is all about mixing up the opponent. Rosso still has access to the regular mixup tools, so remember to use your Lows, normal Throws, Hard Attack crossup j.LK, empty jump-ins into Lows and frame-traps to open the opponent up. However, Rosso also has a built-in Short Hop with his Le Ali Di Aero(PP/PP) allowing him to get incredibly quick Overheads and a even better empty jump-in to Low than usual, both of which can be combo'd from. Rosso's Vulcanus(214P/4P) also forces the opponent to block and becomes even better if used meaty. You can also force the opponent to quickly switch the direction they block by using Sciara Del Fuoco (236K/6K) to dash through the opponent. Naturally, mixups can be enforced on most knockdowns, but a great way to set this up is with Rosso's staple combo, listed in the Universal Strings below. Set-Ups Any knockdown > (Sciara Del Fuoco (236K/6K) if you need to catch up) > Vulcanus (214MP/4MP) Basically the thing you do when you get a knockdown, forces the opponent to block and if they don't, you get to combo for free. While they are blocking, you also get to mix them up for free. Try to set this up whenever possible. Meaty Vulcanus (214MP/4MP) > 2MK > Le Ali Di Aero(PP/PP) > Rage Of Vesuvio (236P/6P) > Torre Pendente Di Pisa (214214P/64P) A difficult but worthwhile combo that also doubles as a mixup even if blocked or dropped. The Super puts the opponent into the exact same situation, allowing this set-up to repeated over and over. Going from Low to Overhead extremely quick is just par for the course for Vulcano Rosso. Frame-Traps Any Delayed Chain As there is always a big window for you to chain one move to a higher strength, essentially any button can become a frame trap by simply delaying the next button just enough to allow a gap for an opponent to press a button that'll then get hit by your delayed button before their move can start up. The easiest way of practicing this by setting the training dummy to \"After First Hit\" and Guard All (Standing) or Guard All (Crouching), and setting either 5LP or 2LP in a slot for \"Recording Settings (After Guard). The dummy will try to jab their way out of any gaps and if you've delayed correctly, you'll hit the dummy out of the startup of their jab. 2MP or 2MK are great normals to try and frame trap from. 2MP/2MK > Rage Of Vesuvio (236P/6P) Rosso's main way of frame trapping normally from these normals. Sadly is unsafe if blocked so is fairly risky to go for. However, attempting the Umiliazione Di Canossa(214K/4K) adds yet another layer, as someone punishing the Rage Of Vesuvio can then caught by the counter. This in turn is also unsafe if the opponent doesn't take the bait or simply does an attack that doesn't trigger the specific strength of the counter (IE. Lows will beat 214MK.) Defense While Vulcano Rosso can make defense a living hell for other characters, Rosso isn't particularly good at defense himself. A lack of good Special Reversals and pretty poor Supers mean that Rosso mostly has to hold any pressure or otherwise rely on Guard Cancel if he's running a deck that uses it. Thankfully, as Rosso can often have meter in stock, he's quite happy to pay the 1 bar. Reversals Rosso lacks particularly good reversals. His counters have startup before the actual counter becomes active, making them very poor as reversals. If you need to use a reversal, either use Accelerando(214214K/64K) or 236236P. Ponte Dei Sospiri (236236P/46P) Escapes Vulcano Rosso despite lacking good reversals does have ways of escaping quickly. His Sciara Del Fuoco (236K/6K) is pretty decent for dashing through the opponent. Along with his mobility and preferred decks that include Ghost or Utsusemi, Vulcano Rosso can sneak his way through gaps. Character Specific Techniques Combos All characters can chain from a normal to a higher strength normal, either punch or kick. Chains work off cancels, meaning that the button doesn't have to finish its animation and can go immediately to the next normal. When links are mentioned, that means the normal HAS to finish and then you can get the next normal to come out. These tend to be harder. Unique/command normals chain from any normal. Bread And Butter Combos (Note: Almost all of these strings will work from jump in starters.) Universal Strings 2/5LK > 2MK > 2HK A somewhat okay string. Unfortunately, 2HK is - on block and can be punished by 2LK easily. If you space it correctly so that you are pushed back far enough, particularly in the corner, you can be pushed out far enough that you can block in time. 2/5LK > 2MK > Rage Of Vesuvio (236P/6P) > P Follow Up > K Follow Up A decent meterless string with alright options for follow up. If you have the bar, you'll want to do the combo listed below. 2/5LK > 2MK > Rage Of Vesuvio (236P/6P) > P Follow Up > Torre Pendente Di Pisa (214214P/64P) Basically THE combo for Vulcano Russo. Works anywhere on the screen, lets you get a good vortex setup by chasing after the opponent and is even better in the corner. This is the general framework for your combo.s Dash-In combos 2MP > 2MP > 2MK > Rage Of Vesuvio (236P/6P) > P Follow Up > Torre Pendente Di Pisa (214214P/64P) The momentum from your dash allows you to link (Not chain, so timing is a lot more strict) a second 2MP which can then link into 2MK . This is definitely more difficult than your chains and on blocks there's fairly noticeable gaps that the opponent can jab through. Frametrap with cancelling your 2MP s or 2MK s into either 5HK or Rage Of Vesuvio (236P/6P). A very respectable punish combo against very unsafe moves like Rising Dragons or many blocked supers. Hit-Confirms 2LK> 2MK > Whatever Rosso doesn't have particularly good strings that end in safe Specials or Supers. If you aren't hit confirming, it's best to end with the 2MK. At certain spacings, you can sneak in a 2HK, but as it knocks down it has no combo potential. Anti-Air Conversions 5MP/5MK>2HP > Torre Pendente Di Pisa (214214P/64P) A fairly consistent conversion that gets really nice knockdown and corner carry. Air to Air Conversions j.MK/HK > 5MK > Torre Pendente Di Pisa (214214P/64P) A fairly decent conversion, sadly Rosso doesn't have any air Specials or Supers to easily confirm into. It's best to attempt a 5MK and buffer the Super. Depending on where you are in your jump arc and where the opponent is, this may not be possible to land, so make sure you know the Super will hit. 3 Bar Super Sequence !!! quote \"Accelerando(214214K/64K) (Cancel on 12 th Hit) > Ponte Dei Sospiri (236236P/46P) (Cancel on 3 rd hit > Accelerando(214214K/64K)\" If you HAVE to spend 3 bars, this is the most damaging Super Sequence. Unless this will definitely kill though, this is never worth the bar.","title":"Vulcano Rosso"},{"location":"characters/vulcano-rosso/#brief-overview","text":"","title":"Brief Overview"},{"location":"characters/vulcano-rosso/#type-of-character","text":"Vulcano Russo is a rushdown/vortex character with a somewhat unorthodox kit. He has access to a slow short-ranged multi-hit fireball, a command dash, a command short hop, a simple rekka series and 2 different kinds of counter moves. He lacks Unique Normals aside from Hard Attack and has some strange normals, making his strings slightly different. His damage is somewhat low and isn't able to dump his meter into high damage like some other characters. Despite this, he has THE best vortex in the game and fantastic mixup, causing him to keep the pressure on opponents even after they get up and can often open the opponent back up and starting his vortex all over again. Vulcano Rosso is the character to play if you like being able to put the other character into a blender, forcing the opponent to try and block both Low/Overhead and left/right, and playing with a eclectic selection of Special Moves. Strengths Extremely strong vortex that can lead back into itself. Superb mix up with his command dash and command short hop, allows him to convert his pressure into a full combo. - Strong anti-air normals with fairly decent conversions - Good mobility with decent walk speed and run speed and a command dash Weaknesses Somewhat low damage even with meter, struggles to cash in more than one bar of meter in a combo. No real fireball game, forcing him to be up close to get anything done Outside of setups with Vulcanus, lacks a lot of ways to end blockstrings safely other than cutting them short.

Take Shinobi as your deck, if you can activate its gougi will let you turn invisible, make your Hard Attack (MP+MK) unblockable and lets you do Specials and Supers out of blockstun. To quickly activate Ghost, keep the opponent away for 12 seconds at the start of the match with 214P 2LK, 2MP, 2MK, 5HK are all good buttons to poke with. If someone is jumping in on you, either do 5MK or 2HP. If you land either of these as an antiair, 214214P is a good way of getting damage to score a knockdown. For jumping in, use j.MK as it does 2 hits. For combos, start off with light kicks or punches, move up to medium kicks or punches and then to hard kicks or punches. Easiest one is 2LK > 2MK > 2HK. If your combo lands, as long as you haven't done 2HK yet you can do 236P, and then follow up with P and K immediately afterwards to a second punch and a kick, sending the opponent flying to the corner. If you have a bar of Meter, do the second punch and then cancel to 214214P. If the opponent is knocked down, either close the gap with 236K, or do 214P (ideally the MP or HP version) to force the opponent to block as they get up. You can also mix it up with PP (a short hop that lets you hit overhead extremely quickly with K) and 214HK to zip past the opponent along with the usual low hitting moves and throws to open up the opponent. If you can open them up, try to combo so that you put them right back in the same situation. For the most part you can ignore his counters. The KK counter lets you stop a projectile and do a quick dash attack that can be cancelled into a super like 236236K or 236236P.

Guard Cancel as always is a fantastic defensive Gougi. Vulcano Rosso struggles to spend meter as is, so doesn't mind spending the bar either on his Rage of Vesuvio or his counters, Umiliazione Di Canossa. Guard Break allows Vulcano Russo to set up difficult to escape unblockable situations and get huge rewards. Doesn't quite get to land the Hard Attacks for free like D.Dark does, but is still not too bad at sneaking them in. Ghost makes approaching much easier for Vulcano Russo, allowing him to start enforcing his pressure and vortex much more reliably. Once he's in, a quick dash makes his mixup even scarier and unpredictable. Is also fairly good at stalling for the 12 seconds needed to Trigger the Ghost with his 214P which is pretty good at preventing the opponent from rushing in. Stealth Raptor Very solid selection of Blue Gougi, the 2 Speed Ups boosts V.Rosso's mobility by 20% while the Grab Up gives him a handy range increase, making his shimmying even stronger. Utsusemi helps with V.Rosso's lackluster defense and prevents a lot of other characters from enforcing their vortex and mixup on Rosso himself. Hunting Dash gives Rosso a even better Short Hop with a different timing. Infinity Probably the best Blue Gougi of any deck, allowing you to get 130% meter gain near instantly. This lets V.Rosso get the bars needed for Guard Cancel and his combos into his Torre Pendente Di Pisa so he can ensure a hard knockdown. Guard Cancel as always is a fantastic defensive Gougi. Vulcano Rosso struggles to spend meter as is, so doesn't mind spending the bar either on his Rage of Vesuvio or his counters, Umiliazione Di Canossa. His command hop is also very nice for punishing easy Low blockstrings. Rage is a very nice buff for Rosso's meter gain. While Rosso isn't fantastic at spending a lot of meter, always having the bar for his Torre Pendente Di Pisa and Guard Cancels is incredibly useful While this isn't the absolute best fit for Rosso, the deck itself is so strong that it's still probably his go-to Deck outside of Shinobi and is by far the easiest one to make use out of. Nightmare Very easy Blue Gougi to Trigger, getting a permanent 20% Speed boost with 2 Speed Ups after only 10 seconds into the match is ideal for Rosso. Ghost just like with Shinobi is an easy Yellow Gougi to Trigger with an amazing Effect that massively buffs Rosso's approach and Mix Up. Energy Drain is the main difference between taking Shinobi and taking Nightmare. Rosso can very easily score the 4 knockdowns needed for Energy Drain, and its Effect gives Rosso both a source of Meter Gain and also gets rid of meter from the opponent that they could otherwise use for Guard Cancels or Reversal Supers. Soul Drain is honestly icing on the cake and is most likely going to be Triggered in the final round, but it makes his pressure even more disgusting, shredding the enemy of their Health and Meter. This is fairly similar to Shinobi, but while Shinobi has more utility with Guard Break and especially Guard Cancel, Nightmare makes his vortex even stronger and rewarding with a powerful late-game Effect in his Soul Drain.","title":"Recommended Decks"},{"location":"characters/vulcano-rosso/#move-analysis","text":"","title":"Move Analysis"},{"location":"characters/vulcano-rosso/#notation","text":"This guide uses Numpad notation.

Umiliazione Di Canossa(214K/4K) A counter move that makes Vulcano Russo pose and will do an automatic counter attack if it blocks the right kind of normal. The strength of the kick determines whether you block Overheads, Mids or Lows respectively. The the Mid and Overhead counter can be followed up with by a normal (use 2MP or 2MK) allowing for some decent damage. The Low counter does an special counter attack that cannot be followed up on. This takes some time to start up, so it's a pretty bad idea to do as you're getting up as any proper meaty attempt will beat it out. ?/?/? ?/?/? ?/?/? Regalo(KK/KK) Vulcano Rosso's other counter move, this one stops projectiles and does an automatic long reaching dash punch that can be Super Cancelled. Pretty good for what it does, but an opponent depending on timing and spacing can actually block or completely beat out the automatic counter move. ?/?/? ?/?/? ?/?/?","title":"Specials"},{"location":"characters/vulcano-rosso/#supers","text":"Quick note, in startup framedata (eg. x + y), x means the startup until Super Freeze and Y is the startup for the super to come out afterwards. Super Description Startup S.blo C.blo Ponte Dei Sospiri (236236P/46P) A series of punches that ends with a series of curbstomps on grounded opponents. Fairly quick and with decent reach and leaves you in a good position for your vortex. However, for setting up vortex Torre Pendente Di Pisa is much better as it sends the opponent the perfect distance off an aerial hit which is easily combo'd into from the second hit of Rage of Vesuvio, so this is usually better if you cannot get the opponent off the ground during a combo (IE. You've ended your chain in a heavy attack). Probably the best super to use as a reversal. ? + ? ? ? Torre Pendente Di Pisa(214214P/64P) A 6 hit pillar of flame sent out at an angle. A semi decent anti-air but really finds its niche as the best super to use on opponents that have been sent into the air by another anti-air or air-to air or combo. If instantly cancelled into from the second hti of Rage of Vesuvio, it sends the opponent spiralling upwards at the perfect height to easily follow up on from anywhere on the screen. This becomes even better in the corner, and is probably what you'll be spending your bar on along with any Gougi that use it, like Stealth Raptor. Not great for going into other supers, but Rosso doesn't really have a good sequence of supers to do in a combo anyway. ? + ? ? ? Accelerando(214214K/64K) A series of kicks into a series of punches. The 13 th hit knocks down. This Super is mostly useful to string into other supers as it has a pretty short range but does have a lot of hits to get your Super Cancel in. Unfortunately, this really leads to very lackluster damage (62 damage going from Accelerando to Ponte Dei Sospiri back to Accelerando, very poor for 3 bars.) and you're probably best keeping your meter. ? + ? ? ?","title":"Supers"},{"location":"characters/vulcano-rosso/#gameplan","text":"","title":"Gameplan"},{"location":"characters/vulcano-rosso/#neutral","text":"Rosso wants to mainly use his crouching normals and 2LK to poke and approach, as his 5MK is a dedicated anti-air that easily whiffs on crouchers.

The easiest way of practicing this by setting the training dummy to \"After First Hit\" and Guard All (Standing) or Guard All (Crouching), and setting either 5LP or 2LP in a slot for \"Recording Settings (After Guard).

Gougi is the most recognizable unique mechanic for Fighting Ex Layer. When you pick your character, you also choose a deck of Gougi. Gougi is a set of 5 powerups that activate when certain conditions are met and give passive or active effects for the rest of the match (not just the round, the whole match!) How does Gougi work? For the sake of example, let's take a look at Aggro: The Trigger is the condition you need to fill for the Gougi's Effect to activate. So, with Grab Up, once you land 2 non-command throws, you get a nice 20% increase to your grab range for the rest of the match. Erase Blow also has a simple Trigger with a simple but useful effect. You'll notice these less impactful Gougi are in blue, blue signifying that they are easy to get but not massively powerful. Yellow Gougi on the other hand are much more difficult to Trigger, often requiring more than one round to Trigger. They make up for this with extremely powerful effects that are often the centerpiece of the deck. Illusion requires taking 300 damage (For reference, characters have 200 health, meaning this will always take at least one round to Trigger.) but give you an automatic free escape from 1 highly damaging combo per round. Rampage is what makes Aggro the Aggro deck as its Effect increases your damage as you hit the opponent up to a max of 30 stacks (1% damage increase per stack???) while having a fairly reasonable Trigger to activate early in the match. Essentially, Blue Gougi are nice bonuses while Yellow Gougi are the powerful effects that you build up to in a match. These will also affect your character's playstyle, allowing them to play up their strengths or cover their weaknesses. Allen Snider loves Infinity as he wants meter, is good at building it up and constantly being topped up with the Rage Effect allows him to consistently do full Triple Break Loops to finish off matches. A Darun Mister on the other hand can take Thunderbolt, allowing him to use the Teleport Gougi to warp on top of the opponent, negating his poor mobility. What should I base my Gougi Deck choices on? While there will be \"best\" Decks for characters, if you want to mess around with the Decks, first consider what the character wants to do. Grab Master probably won't get much mileage on Kairi and his lack of command grabs for example. Doctrine Dark has excellent mixup but not an amazing approach so Shinobi with its Ghost Gougi covers his weakness and allows his strength to excel. Also, do you want to enjoy the effects of your Gougi as soon as possible or are you okay being relatively weaker than your opponent for the beginning of the match? Some Decks require completely changing the way you play to Trigger the Gougi such as Miracle or Super Nova. Shinobi has very good effects especially considering how easy the Triggers are, but compared to a fully activated Juggernaut is arguably less powerful. Most characters thankfully have more than one optimal deck in any case, so you'll still be able to mess around and not hamper yourself. See the character pages for recommendations. List of Decks Deck Gougi Used Recommended Characters Notes Aggro Rampage , Illusion , Chip Up , Grab Up , Erase Blow Allen Snider This deck is probably the most solid deck to pick if you're not quite sure what to take. All the effects are decently powerful and intuitive and can be used by the whole cast. Juggernaut Hades , Guard Break , Meter Up , Speed Up Darun Mister Another pretty decent beginner Deck, Hades will completely destroy anyone who doesn't understand how to beat super armour, and the blue Gougi are all easy to activate with good effects. Shinobi Ghost , Guard Cancel , Guard Break , Speed Up , Attack Up Doctrine Dark One of the best decks in the game, Ghost's fantastic Effect for offense and Guard Cancel, one of the best Gougi, for defense makes for a incredibly versatile deck. Infinity Rage , Guard Cancel , Meter Up , Meter Up , Meter Up Allen Snider, Jack, Shirase Specially good for meter dependant characters. Loop characters heavily benefit from this deck because of the meter ups.

Notes Grab Master Kraken Power , Kraken Grab , Grab Up , Speed Up , Erase Blow Darun Mister Notes List of Gougi Gougi Used in Decks Trigger Effect Notes Rampage Aggro Deal over 40 Damage in a single Combo. Damage increase the more you attack. As you attack the opponent, you build up stacks (up to 30) that increase your damage by 0.75%(?). You will lose these stacks if the opponent hasn't been hit or forced to blocked for 5 consecutive seconds. Landing hits will build up far more stacks than hits that are blocked. Illusion Aggro , Double Face , Sky Dancer Receive over 300 points of Damage. Become able to escape combos once per round. A pretty excellent Yellow Gougi that does take at least 1 round to activate, this allows you to escape combos once a round. This activates once a combo hits at least 50 damage (25% Health.) Hades Juggernaut , Miracle Get knocked down 12 times Gain Super Armour Super Armour means that your character doesn't recoil from most hits. You will still take damage, but you will be able to fully act. This means your character can get full punishes on BEING hit by an opponent, walk through projectiles and consistently win trades. However, being knocked down, juggled or launched will still work as normal against Super Armour. Damage that is Super Armour'd through will be unscaled, so notably multihit moves and supers will actually do more damage than normal (For example, Allen Snider's Fire Force.) Guard Break Juggernaut , Shinobi , Sky Dancer , Supernova Attack your opponent with 4 Hard Attacks. Hard Attacks become Guard Breaks. Harkening back to Guard Breaks from Street Fighter EX2, your Hard Attacks will become Guard Breaks for 1 bar of meter. Guard Breaks are flashy unblockable attacks that if they land will cause the opponent to reel for a very long time. You should be able to get full punishes each time with this, and some characters have extremely good setups to make sure the Guard Break lands such as Doctrine Dark. They're also just useful as a mixup tool regardless. If you don't have a bar of meter, a normal Hard Attack comes out instead. Ghost Shinobi , Nightmare Avoid your opponent for 12 seconds Turn invisible during Forward Dashes. A fantastic Yellow Gougi that makes any character's approach incredibly scary. The camera does still track, so midscreen this can be used to judge where the Ghosted character is. No such luck in the corner. You are invisible for 2 seconds after dashing or until you make an attack. Guard Cancel Shinobi , Infinity , Double Face , Babel Guard 30 attacks. Become able to cancel Guards into Special Attack/Super Combos. As it says on the tin, while blocking, input a Special or Super and your character will flash green and throw out the Special/Super Move. Excellent defensive Gougi and any deck with it is probably a winner. Rage Infinity , Supernova Spend 10 Blocks of Super Meter Gain the ability to recover Super Meter. The Effect is a little deceptive. If you aren't gaining meter for 4 seconds (ie. not attacking or throwing out specials), you'll start to rapidly gain meter. It takes about 5 seconds to get the full 150 meter. A late-game Gougi but has a suitably strong effect. Overload Miracle , Supernova While having MAX Super Meter, attack 25 Special Attacks. Activate all other Gougi. Is basically the intended way for you to Trigger your deck with Miracle and Supernova . Despite being easier to do than triggering each individual Gougi, this is still probably too difficult and is very much a win-more gougi (If you're managing to stay alive long enough that you can get the 25 Special Attacks off and have no Gougi to use until then, you would probably be winning regardless.) Mammoth Miracle Spend 20 blocks of Super Meter. Increase Damage by 35%. A Miracle -only Effect that's just out-and-out strong, the real limit here is that its Trigger is unreasonably difficult to activate and even the Overload Gougi designed to Trigger these difficult Gougi is arguably too difficult anyway. Hunting Dash Stealth Raptor Attack your opponent with an Attack out of a Dash 15 times. Input Down, Up to perform a Short Hop. (This uses Meter) This uses 25 Meter (Half a bar, shown with a small notch on each bar of Meter. This lets you go for crazy instant overheads that lead to full jump-in overheads. Anyone who has played King Of Fighters knows how good these can be and enables every character to have a very strong Low/High mixup. Utsusemi Miracle , Stealth Raptor Perform a Recovery 5 times. Turn invisible during Recoveries. To Recover, press a button as you land on the ground from a juggle or knockdown. The invisibility lasts less than a second, but does make it much harder for the opponent to chase you down from a knockdown. A solid defensive Gougi. 6 Chain Berserker Perform 15 Chain Combos. Chain Combos becomes 6 Chains. One of two Berserker exclusive Yellow Gougi, 6 Chains mean that the usual chain system to lower strength to higher strength gets the addition that you can go to a punch to a same strength kick (ie. MP > MK becomes a chain, not a link) before going to the higher Strength. This lets you do something like LP > LK > MP > MK > HP > HK . Allows you to pull off some ridiculous blockstrings/strings (mostly from dash ins, getting full 6 chains is impossible without some momentum) and combines very well with Pierce. Pierce Berserker Attack your opponents 30 times. Normal Attacks deal Chip Damage. The second Berserker exclusive Yellow Gougi, this lets your normals do actual Chip Damage, Mortal Kombat style. Light attacks deal 1 Chip Damage, Medium Attacks deal 2, and Heavies deal 3. In combination with 6 Chain, this allows for your blockstrings to deal some serious chip even before you get to your specials. A full 6 Chain does a whopping 12 chip damage (For reference, Fire Force deals 5, 10 with Chip Up.) Heads or Tails Double Face Complete 1 Round. Win: Activate 6 Chain Lose: Health 50% -> Hades will activate. See the Hades and 6 Chain Gougi for more info. Unfortunately, neither Effect here is amazingly good. 6 Chain without the support of Pierce is not as good, and Hades only activating at half health on a round loss means it can very easily be too late for Hades to be useful. This Gougi does let you access these Effects quicker than their respective Decks and Triggers, but especially after the nerf isn't as much of a no-brainer. EX Arrow Sky Dancer Block an Aerial Attack 4 times. By inputting Down > Up, you can jump directly to your opponent. A free tracking super jump makes this excellent for mobility and allows for jump-in combos from full screen. Can unfortunately not crossup. Energy Drain Nightmare Knock your opponent down 4 times. Drain Super Meter from a downed opponent. The cornerstone of the Nightmare Deck, this not only gets you meter but also steals it from the opponent. If the opponent doesn't have meterless reversals, Nightmare can very easily force them to completely respect you as they wake up without any chance of using their supers.. Soul Drain Miracle , Nightmare Drain a total of 99 Super Meter from your opponent. Drain Super Meter and Health by getting near your opponent. Similar to Energy Drain except this works just by staying close to the opponent. This means this is active while standing next to them, even on block, and also in any combos that keep you close enough. Many Supers will also keep you close enough to have it active, and throws are especially good for getting the full use of Soul Drain. The health loss can never kill but will leave the opponent at 1 Health. A very difficult Gougi to activate but well worth it. Desperation Babel Perform Special Attacks or Super Combos 8 times. Damage increases the more you land Special Attacks/Super Combos Each individual Special or Super move hit builds a stack (Must hit, can't be blocked, maxes out at 99 stacks), increases the damage of Specials or Supers by roughly 7.5% per stack. Is a genuinely solid increase in damage for special moves with a reasonable Trigger to pull off. However, it suffers from a really major downside in that all stacks are lost if the move is blocked or whiffed, making it actually a fairly underwhelming Gougi overall. Is still good for characters that can hit-confirm into specials and don't need to throw them out constantly . Meter Power Supernova Build 5 bars of Super Meter Gain a Damage boost depending on how much Super Meter you have. Each bar gives you a 3.33% damage increase for a max of 10%. Not too bad especially as the Trigger is very reasonable. Unfortunately stuck on Supernova where it's fairly underwhelming. Critical Thunderbolt Avoid your opponent for 12 seconds. Gain a large Damage boost for a limited time. When the timer fills up (takes 8 seconds), the next attack that lands deal 50% more damage. A bit underwhelming as if it lands during a combo, it'd do 50% of the scaled damage. Meter Gross Fantasista Perform 2 Reversals Gain Meter when performing Reversals Increases the amount of meter gained by 50% (the base 10 meter for reversals going to 15.) A decent reward but given that reversals are pretty dangerous if blocked most of the time, this makes this Gougi not very useful and worthless if you're not getting knocked down. Power Reversal Fantasista Attack 5 Reversals. Reversals gain a Damage boost. If the reversal logo comes out (IE. you got the move to come out as soon as you got up), you get a pretty major 50% damage increase to the move. Suffers from the same problem as Meter Gross where making use of the reversal effect is dangerous and not applicable if you're not getting knocked down. Disrupt Fantasista , Supernova Perform a Super Cancel from a Super Combo 2 times. Spend all Super Meter to perform a powerful Super Combo. This Gougi is often outright bad. It offers roughly a 33% damage increase on the super at the expense of your entire meter and will provide less of a damage boost the less meter you have. For example, D.Dark's EX-Prominence goes from a base 34 to 51 with 3 bars which is pretty pathetic. Spending the same amount of meter to do Dark Shackle > Dark Knife > Dark Shackle does 49 damage and that's with a very poor Super sequence. Any supers that relaunch naturally become much worse as they can no longer loop. If your character can only have 1 super in a combo it may be slightly better, It's usually always better to do 3 separate supers in 3 combos or strings than do slightly more damage in one. Kraken Power Grab Master Perform a Special Throw or Throw Super Combo 5 times. Increase Special Throw and Throw Super Combo Damage by 20%. Does exactly what it says on the tin. Excellent for characters with high damage command grabs like Darun or grab supers in general (ie. Skullomania, Shadowgeist). Kraken Grab Grab Master Spend a total of 10 seconds close to your opponent. Special/Super Throw Range 30% UP. (Some exceptions.) A pretty disgusting range increase, turns Darun's command grab to full-on Super Turbo Zangief SPD range. Chip Up Aggro , Sky Dancer Deal 40 points of Chip Damage. Increase Chip Damage by 1. A surprisingly effective Gougi. Using Allen as an example, his Soul Force deals 2 chip damage, so Chip Up adds 50% damage. Fire Force deals 1 chip damage 5 times, meaning that Chip Up adds 100% damage. Basically, the more hits something has, the more effective Chip Up becomes making it superb on characters with many-hit blockstrings that use specials or supers (For example, Shadowgeist.). Grab Up Aggro , Stealh Raptor , Berserker , Double Face , Grab Master Land 2 Normal Throws. Increase Normal Throw range by 20%. Another pretty excellent Effect with a reasonably easy Trigger, this makes shimmies and your general grab game better which every character can make use of. Erase Blow Aggro , Berserker , Grab Master Attack your opponent with Heavy Attacks 3 times. Gain the ability to negate projectiles with Heavy Attacks. The use of Erase isn't immediately obvious. If someone is playing their fireball game to chip you out, Erase can shut it down completely, but is otherwise fairly underwhelming on most characters as most heavy attacks are slow and horrible to whiff. Meter Up Juggernaut , Infinity , Berserker , Babel , Thunderbolt , Fantasista Attack your opponent 10 times. Increase Super Meter Gain by 10%. Probably one of the best Blue gougi and is very easy to activate. One solid blockstring or combo will be enough to activate it and every character wants meter. Speed Up Juggernaut , Shinobi , Stealth Raptor , Double Face , Nightmare , Babel , Grab Master Allow 10 Seconds to pass in game. Increase Movement Speed by 10%. By far the easiest Gougi to activate in the game and has a pretty nice effect to boot, increasing both your walk AND run speed. Excellent for approaching and fine movement (IE. shimmies.) Attack Up Juggernaut , Shinobi , Babel , Thunderbolt , Fantasista Build 1 Bar of Super Meter. Increase Damage by 5%. A decent enough effect and easy enough to Trigger. Frenzy Sky Dancer , Thunderbolt Remain, below 50 Health for 6 seconds. Increase Damage as your Health is lowered. 50 Health is 25% of your max Health and the damage increase is 10%. A pretty decent Effect with a reasonable Trigger. Resources A overview of all the gougi decks in the game by PB Geki.","title":"Gougi"},{"location":"system/gougi/#what-are-gougi","text":"Gougi is the most recognizable unique mechanic for Fighting Ex Layer. When you pick your character, you also choose a deck of Gougi. Gougi is a set of 5 powerups that activate when certain conditions are met and give passive or active effects for the rest of the match (not just the round, the whole match!)","title":"What Are Gougi?"},{"location":"system/gougi/#how-does-gougi-work","text":"For the sake of example, let's take a look at Aggro: The Trigger is the condition you need to fill for the Gougi's Effect to activate. So, with Grab Up, once you land 2 non-command throws, you get a nice 20% increase to your grab range for the rest of the match. Erase Blow also has a simple Trigger with a simple but useful effect. You'll notice these less impactful Gougi are in blue, blue signifying that they are easy to get but not massively powerful. Yellow Gougi on the other hand are much more difficult to Trigger, often requiring more than one round to Trigger. They make up for this with extremely powerful effects that are often the centerpiece of the deck. Illusion requires taking 300 damage (For reference, characters have 200 health, meaning this will always take at least one round to Trigger.) but give you an automatic free escape from 1 highly damaging combo per round. Rampage is what makes Aggro the Aggro deck as its Effect increases your damage as you hit the opponent up to a max of 30 stacks (1% damage increase per stack???) while having a fairly reasonable Trigger to activate early in the match. Essentially, Blue Gougi are nice bonuses while Yellow Gougi are the powerful effects that you build up to in a match. These will also affect your character's playstyle, allowing them to play up their strengths or cover their weaknesses. Allen Snider loves Infinity as he wants meter, is good at building it up and constantly being topped up with the Rage Effect allows him to consistently do full Triple Break Loops to finish off matches. A Darun Mister on the other hand can take Thunderbolt, allowing him to use the Teleport Gougi to warp on top of the opponent, negating his poor mobility.","title":"How does Gougi work?"},{"location":"system/gougi/#what-should-i-base-my-gougi-deck-choices-on","text":"While there will be \"best\" Decks for characters, if you want to mess around with the Decks, first consider what the character wants to do. Grab Master probably won't get much mileage on Kairi and his lack of command grabs for example. Doctrine Dark has excellent mixup but not an amazing approach so Shinobi with its Ghost Gougi covers his weakness and allows his strength to excel. Also, do you want to enjoy the effects of your Gougi as soon as possible or are you okay being relatively weaker than your opponent for the beginning of the match? Some Decks require completely changing the way you play to Trigger the Gougi such as Miracle or Super Nova. Shinobi has very good effects especially considering how easy the Triggers are, but compared to a fully activated Juggernaut is arguably less powerful. Most characters thankfully have more than one optimal deck in any case, so you'll still be able to mess around and not hamper yourself. See the character pages for recommendations.","title":"What should I base my Gougi Deck choices on?"},{"location":"system/gougi/#list-of-decks","text":"Deck Gougi Used Recommended Characters Notes Aggro Rampage , Illusion , Chip Up , Grab Up , Erase Blow Allen Snider This deck is probably the most solid deck to pick if you're not quite sure what to take.

This is the most simple form of movement. While walking, attacks will be Standing Normals. Different characters have different walk speeds. 4 or 1 will also make your character block attacks, standing and crouching respectively, so if your character needs to block, they will do that instead of walking back. Walk Speed can be increased by Triggered Speed Up Gougi. Run Press 66 and hold 6 to run forward. This gets you moving a lot quicker and also gives you dash-in momentum, making you skid forward. While running, attacks will be Standing Normals (IE. 5LP , 5MK ). You can press and hold 4 or 1 and start blocking, standing and crouching respecively. Different characters have different run speeds. Run Speed can be increased by Triggered Speed Up Gougi. Crouch Press 1, 2 or 3 to crouch down. This gives you access to a different set of normal moves called Crouching Normals. (IE. 2LP , 2MK ) You cannot move while crouched. If you press and hold 1, you will also do crouching blocks if you need to block, so using 1 by default is the best way to crouch. Backdash Press 44 to backdash. Your character moves away quicker than walking backwards but must finish their backdash before they can block, attack or do anything else. Backdashes have no invulnerability for normal attacks so are purely for movement in that sense. They are also not considered airborne even if a lot of characters seem to move off the ground. However they are throw invulnerable which makes them useful for baiting normal and command throws. Jumping Pressing 8 will make your character jump straight up, 9 will make them jump forward and 7 will make them jump back. You cannot block, but you get access to a new suite of normals and possibly some new special moves or supers (dependent on character, most specials and supers are either on-ground or in-air.) Characters also have different speeds and jump arcs. Allen has a fairly normal jump that is noticably higher and slower than Shirase's jump but is faster than Pullum's jump for example. Dash-in Momentum Dash-in momentum is what it sounds like, your character gets to keep moving for a bit after a run forward before they come to a halt. This lets them do advancing normals and create combos that normally wouldn't be possible by staying in range for the next hit using dash-in momentum to combat the pushback that naturally comes up when moves hit. Learning this is the key to really pulling off chains and combos as a lot of chains don't naturally hit. Combo System What is a combo? A combo is a series of attacks you make that the opponent takes and cannot act between. If you do a combo, you will see a hit counter appear under your character which will increment with each hit in the combo until the combo \"drops\" and the opponent can act again. By using your normals, special moves and super moves well, you can constuct longer and longer combos that deal more and more damage, letting you get the most out of a hit. Some moves have more than one hit that will naturally combo anyway such as Fire Force, which is a large fireball that has 5 hits. While this is technically a combo, combos from now on will refer to when you do distinct attacks and get a combo rather just one attack (ie. Fire Force by itself won't be called a combo despite getting 5 hits on the hit while 2MK > Fire Force will, as you made 2 different actions.) Chain FEXL has a fun combo system that allows you to do a normal attack such as 5LP and if it hits, blocked or otherwise, it'll allow you to immediately go into a stronger attack such as 5MP or 5MK . You can switch from crouching to standard normals and vice versa at any time in the chain. This lets you do chains like: Possible String examples 5LP > 5MP > 5HP 5LK > 5MK > 5HP 2LK > 2MK > 2HK 5LK > 5MP > 2HK 2LP > 2MP > 5HK You cannot chain into a normal of the same strength and you can't chain into a lower strength so these won't work : Impossible String examples 2LK > 2LP > 5MP > 5MK > 2HK 5HP > 2MK > 2HK 5HP > 2LK > 5LK There is a specific Gougi called 6 Chain which slightly changes up the rules. This allows you to actually go from a punch to the same strength kick which is normally not possible. Otherwise, the same rules apply. Only Possible when 6 Chain is in effect 5LP > 5LK > 5MP > 5MK > 5HP > 5HK 5LP > 2LK > 2MP > 5MK > 5HP > 2HK Naturally, these chains make comboing and stringing together attacks much easier and are well worth learning. The first thing you should get comfortable with when picking the game or a new character is finding a chain that you can reliably land and lets you deal good damage and/or is safe to do against someone blocking. Lastly, most characters have command normals (called Unique Normals in the move list in-game.) All characters have a Hard Attack listed that can not be chained into, but often they will have another listed move that CAN be chained into from any normal move. For example, Allen has 6MK which can chained into from 5HK which would be impossble if it was a regular normal. You can use these particular command normals to further extend your chain, getting 4 or more hits for your chains. Cancels Cancels are similar to chains in that they allow you to do one move and then immediately go into another move on hit or block. (They're called cancels as you get to \"cancel\" the normal recovery of a move and just start up a whole new move.) This allows you to do normal moves and easily combo into Specials or Supers. There are 2 variations of this, Special Cancels, which means you can cancel into a Special Move. An example of Special Cancellable moves are most character's LPs/LKs and MPs/MKs. For example, Allen can press 2MK and then immediately Special Cancel into Soul Force when the 2MK hits. The other variation is Super Cancels, which work similarly except that you get to do Super Moves. Almost all normal moves are Super Cancellable, but notably you get HPs/HKs are Super Cancellable but NOT Special Cancellable. Some command normals are Super Cancellable. Also, almost all Special Moves are Super Cancellable and all Super Moves are Super Cancellable (not into the same Super so while Allen can Fire Force into Triple Break, he can't Fire Force into Fire Force, after the different super you can go back to the first super you did however IE. Fire Force > Triple Break > Fire Force). In combinations with chains, this allows you to perform a series of normals that all combo into special moves which then combo into supers which adds up for massive damage. A sample combo for almost all characters would be 2LK > 2MK > Special Move > Super Move > Different Super Move > Super Move or 2LK > 2MK > Command Normal > Super Move > Different Super Move > Super Move Links Links are where you cannot chain or cancel a move but are still able to combo, despite having to wait for the first/previous move to fully recover. An example of this for most characters is 2MP into 2MK which if done quickly enough will combo. This is usually much harder but is definitely worth learning once you've grasped chains and cancels. Links are also massively affected by pushback and will often lead to dropped combos. For example, 2MP actually links into itself, but naturally the pushback prevents you from forever linking 2MP to itself. Dash-in momentum counteracts this and allows you get a second 2MP which you would then link into something with more range, often a 2MK . Using links, we can further expand our combos and blockstrings. A sample combo for most characters in dash-in > 2MP > 2MP > 2MK > Special Move > Super Move or dash-in > 2MP > 2MP > 2MK > Command Normal > Super Move. Defense Blocking If you are about to be attacked, if you are holding 4, you will block while standing. If 1 is held instead, you will block while crouching. Blocking is important for not getting heavily damaged or combo'd by every attack the opponent throws out. You can only block on the ground, not in the air. As a rule, if you're not doing anything in particular or you can't do anything (IE. you've done a blockstring and must wait to recover from the last move), holding 4 or 1 is a no-brainer as you'll block instantly as long as your character isn't recovering. Blocking while standing will block attacks that hit High, which is the vast majority of attacks in the game, and attacks that hit Overhead which are almost always jumping Attacks. All Hard Attacks (MP+MK) are overheads and some characters have other command normals that hit overhead. Blocking while crouching will block Highs as well, and will block Lows which are generally Crouching Kicks. Crouch blocking, like most 2D fighting games, is by far the most foolproof kind of block. Many Lows are unreactably fast and on good, rewarding normals such as LKs, MKs and HKs while most Overheads are on jumping Attacks that are much easier to react to, and certain Unique Normals that are also easier to react to and are often not as rewarding as Lows. You want to Crouch Block by default and switch to Standing Block only if you see the opponent attempting a overhead attack. However, Standing Block will actually let you recover from blocking quicker than Crouching Block. Therefore, certain moves will become unsafe if blocked standing, compared to blocking crouched. Doctrine Dark's Death Spinkick ( 4MK ) is -4 on Crouching block, which is only punishable by standing LPs, which are usually out of range anyway. Standing blocks make this move -8 on block instead, which can be punished by most MKs and MPs. For a further explanation on how frame data works, click here . Chip Damage Specials and Supers that are blocked will still inflict damage called Chip Damage, but much less than usual. The amount of chip damage depends on the special and the amount of hits. Multi-hit moves tend to do 1 chip damage per hit while single hit moves can do 3+ damage. Chip damage can kill in this game, like older Street Fighter games, so doing an inescapable string of specials into supers to get chip damage on the opponent is a viable and practical option. Some Decks and Gougi buff this, notably Chip Up in the Aggro deck and the entire Berserker Deck, which has a Gougi called Pierce that allows normal moves to inflict Chip Damage. Frame Data All moves, Specials and Supers have an amount of time for them to start up, an amount of time where the move can actually hit and the amount of time to then return to a neutral state. This is called Startup, Active (frames), and Recovery respectively. FEXL runs at 60 frames per second, so these periods of times are measured in frames, each frame naturally being a 60 th of a second.","title":"Mechanics"},{"location":"system/system-mechanics/#system-mechanics","text":"","title":"System Mechanics"},{"location":"system/system-mechanics/#movement","text":"","title":"Movement"},{"location":"system/system-mechanics/#walk","text":"Press 6 to walk forward, 4 to walk back.
